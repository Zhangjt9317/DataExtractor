    "Scientific articles used in this work are journal publications published by Springer, Wiley, Elsevier, the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the Electrochemical Society from which we received permissions to download large amount of articles. For each publisher, we manually identified all material science related journals available for download. A web scraping engine was built using scrapy. Only full-text articles publihsed after 2000 were downloaded, including metadata such as journal name, article title, article abstract, authors, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "All data were stored in a document-oriented database implemented using a MongoDB database instance. Becasue downloaded articles are in HTML/XML format, which contains irrelevant markups and stylesheets, we developed a customized library for parsing article markup strings into text paragraphs while keeping the structures of paper and sections headings. The current snapshot of the database contains XXX papers, from which we used XXX paragraphs in the experimental sections of each paper to conduct this research. The experimental sections were identified by using case-insensitive keyword matching in section headings. keywords like \"experiment\", \"synthesis\", and their morphological derivations. "

       "['Dynamical systems of a new kind are described, which are motivated by the problem of constructing diffeomorphism invariant quantum theories. These are based on the extremization of a non-local and non-additive quantity that we call the variety of a system. In these systems all dynaqmical variables refer to relative coordinates or, more generally, describe relations between particles, so that they are invariant under discrete analogues of diffeomorphisms in which the labels of all particles are permutted arbitrarily. The variety is a measures of how uniquely each of the elements of the system can be distinguished from the others in terms of the values of these relative coordinates. Thus a system with extremal variety is one in which the parts are related to the whole in as distinct a way as possible.   We study numerically several dynamical systems which are defined by setting the action of the system equal to its variety. We find evidence that suggests that such systems may serve as the basis for a new kind of pregeometry theories in which the geometry of low dimensional space emerges in the thermodynamic limit from a system which is defined without the use of any background space.   The mathematical definition of variety may also provide a quantitative tool to study self-organizing systems, because it distinguishes highly structured, but asymmetric, configurations such as one finds in biological systems from both random configurations and highly ordered configurations.',\n",
       " 'In this paper the connection between standard perturbation theory techniques and the new Bern-Kosower calculational rules for gauge theory is clarified. For one-loop effective actions of scalars, Dirac spinors, and vector bosons in a background gauge field, Bern-Kosower-type rules are derived without the use of either string theory or Feynman diagrams. The effective action is written as a one-dimensional path integral, which can be calculated to any order in the gauge coupling; evaluation leads to Feynman parameter integrals directly, bypassing the usual algebra required from Feynman diagrams, and leading to compact and organized expressions. This formalism is valid off-shell, is explicitly gauge invariant, and can be extended to a number of other field theories.',\n",
       " 'The second order correction to free energy due to the interaction between electrons is calculated for a quasi-one-dimensional conductor exposed to a magnetic field perpendicular to the chains. It is found that specific heat, magnetization and torque oscillate when the magnetic field is rotated in the plane perpendicular to the chains or when the magnitude of magnetic filed is changed. This new mechanism of thermodynamic magnetic oscillations in metals, which is not related to the presence of any closed electron orbits, is applied to explain behavior of the organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$.',\n",
       " 'This thesis is a study of two dimensional noncritical string theory. The main tool which is used, is the matrix model. Introductions to both the Liouville model and its matrix model formulation are included. In particular the special states are discussed. Some calculations of partition functions on genus one using field theory techniques are given. Nonperturbative issues and string theory at finite radius are discussed. Zero momentum correlation functions are calculated using the matrix model. One important result is a set of recursion relations. The treatment is extended to nonzero momentum. The main result is a clear identification of the special states. Some comments on the Wheeler de Witt equation is given. The matrix model $W_{\\\\infty}$ algebra is introduced. This organizes the previous results. In particular, a simple derivation of the genus zero tachyon correlation functions is given. The results are then extended to higher genus. It is seen how a deformation of the algebra is responsible for much of the higher genus structure. Some very explicit formulae are derived. Then the Liouville and matrix model calculations are compared followed by some general conclusions.',\n",
       " 'A simple model that describes traffic flow in two dimensions is studied. A sharp {\\\\it jamming transition } is found that separates between the low density dynamical phase in which all cars move at maximal speed and the high density jammed phase in which they are all stuck. Self organization effects in both phases are studied and discussed.',\n",
       " 'A method is developed whereby spinor helicity techniques can be used to simplify the calculation of loop amplitudes. This is achieved by using the Feynman-parameter representation where the offending off-shell loop momenta do not appear. Background Feynman gauge also helps to simplify the calculations. This method is applicable to any Feynman diagram with any number of loops as long as the external masses can be ignored, and it is at least as efficient as the string technique in the special circumstances when the latter can be used. In order to minimize the very considerable algebra encountered in non-abelian gauge theories, graphical methods are developed for most of the calculations. This enables the large number of terms encountered to be organized visually in the Feynman diagram without the necessity of having to write down any of them algebraically. A one-loop four-gluon amplitude in a particular helicity configuration is computed explicity to illustrate the method.',\n",
       " 'We analyze the dynamical evolution of systems which obey simple growth laws, like diffusion limited aggregation or dielectric breakdown. We show that, if the developing patterns is sufficiently complex, a scale invariant noise spectrum is generated, in agreement with the hypothesis that the system is in a self organized critical state. The intrinsic noise generated in the evolution is shown to be independent of the (extrinsic) stochastic aspects of the growth. Instead, it is related to the complexity of the generated pattern.',\n",
       " 'We study the discrete state structure of $\\\\hat c=1$ superconformal matter coupled to 2-D supergravity. Factorization properties of scattering amplitudes are used to identify these states and to construct the corresponding vertex operators. For both Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors these states are shown to be organized in   SU(2) multiplets. The algebra generated by the discrete states is computed in the limit of null cosmological constant.',\n",
       " 'I introduce a simple continuous probability theory based on the Ginzburg-Landau equation that provides for the first time a common analytical basis to relate and describe the main features of two seemingly different phenomena of condensed-matter physics, namely self-organized criticality and multifractality. Numerical support is given by a comparison with reported simulation data. Within the theory the origin of self-organized critical phenomena is analysed in terms of a nonlinear singularity spectrum different from the typical convex shape due to multifractal measures.',\n",
       " \"This review was given at the 65th birthday meeting of D.W. Sciama, The Renaissance of General Relativity and Cosmology, to be published by Cambridge University Press.

       " 'We give model-independent arguments, valid in nearly any number of spacetime dimensions, that topological solitons and instantons satisfy Bogomol\\'nyi-type bounds and, when these bounds are saturated, satisfy self-duality equations. In the supersymmetric case, we also show that, in spacetime dimensions greater than two, theories with topological charges necessarily exhibit extended supersymmetry, in which the topological charge appears as the central charge. The significance of our arguments lies in their generality. In the supersymmetric case, we obtain insight into the contrast observed between topological charges in 1+1 and higher dimensional models. The centerpiece of our method is to require that the supersymmetric extension of a generic (non-supersymmetric) field theory be self-consistent. Our discussion of supersymmetric extensions is quite detailed, and introduces the notion of the \"associated superfield\" to construct such extensions.',\n",
       " \"A new proof of perturbative renormalizability and infrared finiteness for a scalar massless theory is obtained from a formulation of renormalized field theory based on the Wilson renormalization group. The loop expansion of the renormalized Green functions is deduced from the Polchinski equation of renormalization group. The resulting Feynman graphs are organized in such a way that the loop momenta are ordered. It is then possible to analyse their ultraviolet and infrared behaviours by iterative methods. The necessary subtractions and the corresponding counterterms are automatically generated in the process of fixing the physical conditions for the ``relevant'' vertices at the normalization point. The proof of perturbative renormalizability and infrared finiteness is simply based on dimensional arguments and does not require the usual analysis of topological properties of Feynman graphs.\",\n",
       " 'Recent progress toward classifying low-dimensional chaos measured from time series data is described. This classification theory assigns a template to the time series once the time series is embedded in three dimensions. The template describes the primary folding and stretching mechanisms of phase space responsible for the chaotic motion.

The derivation of the associated zeta function is given (2.2) and the identification of suitable scaling variables discussed (2.3). In section 3 tools necessary for the organization of chaos will be discussed: symbolic dynamics (3.1), the connectivity matrix (3.3), the topological zeta function (3.4) and general transfer matrices and zeta functions (3.5). Although illustrated for the case of hard collisions in a billiard, the symbolic dynamics can be extended to `smooth collisions' in smooth potentials (3.2). In systems with discrete symmetries, zeta functions factorize into zeta functions on invariant subspaces. This symmetry factorization and the associated reduction in symbolics is discussed in section 4. The ideas developed here are illustrated for the example of a free particle reflected elastically off three disks in section 5. Methods to find periodic orbits (5.1), the convergence of the trace formula (5.2), the semiclassical computation of scattering resonances (5.3), the convergence of the cycle expansion (5.4) and methods to obtain eigenvalues of the bounded billiard (5.5) are discussed. The relevant parts of a classical periodic orbit theory are developed in section 6.1, including a discussion of escape rates and the Hannay-Ozorio de Almeida sum rule (6.2). Finally, the issue of semiclassical matrix elements is taken up again and applications to experiments are discussed.\",\n",

However, due to the recursive definition of wavelets, their controllable localization in both space and wave number (time and frequency) domains, and the vanishing moments property, wavelet based algorithms exhibit new and important properties.   For example, the multiresolution structure of the wavelet expansions brings about an efficient organization of transformations on a given scale and of interactions between different neighbouring scales. Moreover, wide classes of operators which naively would require a full (dense) matrix for their numerical description, have sparse representations in wavelet bases. For these operators sparse representations lead to fast numerical algorithms, and thus address a critical numerical issue.   We note that wavelet based algorithms provide a systematic generalization of the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and its descendents.   These topics will be the subject of the lecture. Starting from the notion of multiresolution analysis, we will consider the so-called non-standard form (which achieves decoupling among the scales) and the associated fast numerical algorithms.

To distinguish them from systems with limited computing power, we formulate two simplicity criteria for general dynamical systems, and apply them to unimodal systems on real interval. We say that a dynamical system is regular, if it yields a regular language when observed through arbitrary almost disjoint cover. Finite automata are regarded as dynamical systems on zero-dimensional spaces and their factors yield another class of simple dynamical systems. These two criteria coincide on subshifts, since a subshift is regular iff it is a factor of a finite automaton (sofic systems). A unimodal system on real interval is regular if it has only a finite number of periodic points, and nonrecursive otherwise. On the other hand each $S$-unimodal system with finite, periodic or preperiodic kneading sequence is a factor of a finite automaton. Thus preperiodic $S$-unimodal systems are factors of finite automata, which are not regular.',\n",

For example, in one case, the double dilemma can be resolved for the industry as a whole and productivity then increases steadily over time. In another, the organizational level dilemma may remain unresolved and workers may contribute at fluctuating levels. In this case the overall productivity stays low.

This paper describes an attempt to merge the Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT) approach with psycholinguistic principles. A new formalism for context- free grammars, called *marker-normal form*, is demonstrated and used to describe language data in a way compatible with psycholinguistic theories. By embedding this formalism in a standard multivariate optimization framework, a system can be built that infers correct transfer functions for a set of bilingual sentence pairs and then uses those functions to translate novel sentences. The validity of this line of reasoning has been tested in the development of a system called METLA-1. This system has been used to infer English->French and English->Urdu transfer functions from small corpora. The results of those experiments are examined, both in engineering terms as well as in more linguistic terms. In general, the results of these experiments were psycho- logically and linguistically well-grounded while still achieving a respectable level of success when compared against a similar prototype using Hidden Markov Models.',\n",

Alpha helices are taken as the fundamental collective coordinates of the system, while the refolding is assumed to be mainly driven by solvent-induced hydrophobic forces. A quantitative model of these forces is developed and compared with experimental and theoretical results. The model is then tested by being employed in a simulation scheme designed to mimic solvent effects. Realistic dynamic trajectories of myoglobin are shown as it folds from an extended conformation to a close approximation of the native state. Various suggestive features of the process are discussed. The tenets of the model are further tested by folding the single-chain plant protein leghemoglobin.',\n",

The effective-field-theory framework of nonrelativistic QCD is used to separate the short-distance scale of annihilation, which is set by the heavy quark mass $M$, from the longer-distance scales associated with quarkonium structure. The annihilation decay rates are expressed in terms of nonperturbative matrix elements of 4-fermion operators in nonrelativistic QCD, with coefficients that can be computed using perturbation theory in the coupling constant $\\\\alpha_s(M)$. The matrix elements are organized into a hierarchy according to their scaling with $v$, the typical velocity of the heavy quark. An analogous factorization formalism is developed for the production cross sections of heavy quarkonium in processes involving momentum transfers of order $M$ or larger.

We solve also this extended model and find the correlators of the discrete states by means of the $W$ constraints and the flow equations.

       " 'Psychological investigations have led to considerable insight into the working of the human language comprehension system. In this article, we look at a set of principles derived from psychological findings to argue for a particular organization of linguistic knowledge along with a particular processing strategy and present a computational model of sentence processing based on those principles. Many studies have shown that human sentence comprehension is an incremental and interactive process in which semantic and other higher-level information interacts with syntactic information to make informed commitments as early as possible at a local ambiguity. Early commitments may be made by using top-down guidance from knowledge of different types, each of which must be applicable independently of others. Further evidence from studies of error recovery and delayed decisions points toward an arbitration mechanism for combining syntactic and semantic information in resolving ambiguities. In order to account for all of the above, we propose that all types of linguistic knowledge must be represented in a common form but must be separable so that they can be applied independently of each other and integrated at processing time by the arbitrator. We present such a uniform representation and a computational model called COMPERE based on the representation and the processing strategy.',\n",

With the Schwinger proper-time representation, and the spinor helicity technique, it has been shown that field theories can indeed be written in a string-like manner, thus resulting in simplifications in practical calculations, and providing novel insights into gauge and gravitational theories. This paper continues the study of string organization of field theories by focusing on the question of local duality. It is shown that a single expression for the sum of many diagrams can indeed be written for QED, thereby simulating the duality property in strings. The relation between a single diagram and the dual sum is somewhat analogous to the relation between a old- fashioned perturbation diagram and a Feynman diagram. Dual expressions are particularly significant for gauge theories because they are gauge invariant while expressions for single diagrams are not.',\n",

       " 'A damped chain of particles with harmonic nearest-neighbor interactions in a spatially periodic, piecewise harmonic potential (Frenkel-Kontorova model) is studied numerically. One end of the chain is pulled slowly which acts as a weak driving mechanism. The numerical study was performed in the limit of infinitely weak driving. The model exhibits avalanches starting at the pulled end of the chain. The dynamics of the avalanches and their size and strength distributions are studied in detail. The behavior depends on the value of the damping constant. For moderate values a erratic sequence of avalanches of all sizes occurs. The avalanche distributions are power-laws which is a key feature of self-organized criticality (SOC). It will be shown that the system selects a state where perturbations are just able to propagate through the whole system. For strong damping a regular behavior occurs where a sequence of states reappears periodically but shifted by an integer multiple of the period of the external potential. There is a broad transition regime between regular and irregular behavior, which is characterized by multistability between regular and irregular behavior. The avalanches are build up by sound waves and shock waves. Shock waves can turn their direction of propagation, or they can split into two pulses propagating in opposite directions leading to transient spatio-temporal chaos.

On the other hand, a magnetic field acting on an open Fermi surface induces a dimensional crossover by confining the electronic wave-functions wave-functions along the chains of highest conductivity, which results in a divergence of the orbital critical field and in a stabilization at low temperature of a cascade of superconducting phases separated by first order transistions.

If the high-energy component is formed by jet electrons Compton-scattering radiation from outside the jet, such as the direct or rescattered accretion-disk photons, then the ratio of the power in the high-energy Compton component to the power in the low-energy synchrotron component stands in a simple relation depending on the observing angle to the jet and the plasma outflow speed. When combined with contemporaneous VLBI measurements of apparent transverse speed, we find that a simple diagram relates different classes of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and makes definite predictions for multiwavelength observations of these sources.

These relations are used as the basis of a method for representing the effect of interactions in the Gaussian approximation to field theory, and it is argued that a marked inhomogeneity, in space-time dependence of the sources, forces a discrete spectrum on the field. The development of such a system is characterized by features commonly associated with chaos and self-organization (localization by domain or cell formation). The Green functions play the role of an iterative map in phase space. Stable systems reside at the fixed points of the map. The present work can be applied to self-interacting theories by choosing suitable properties for the sources. Rapid transport leads to a second order phase transition and anomalous dispersion. Finally, it is shown that there is a compact representation of the non-equilibrium dynamics in terms of generalized chemical potentials, or equivalently as a pseudo-gauge theory, with an imaginary charge.

Calculations of the NMR relaxation rate reveal that the FL damping structure can reduce the Hebel--Slichter peak, in agreement with data on the organic superconductor (MDT-TTF)$_2$AuI$_2$. However, the strongly suppressed FL damping in the superconducting state does not eliminate the Hebel-Slichter peak, and thus suggests that other mechanisms are needed to explain the NMR data on (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$, the BEDT organic compounds, and cuprate superconductors.

The model is based on the primitive equations including the moist process, and two kinds of coordinates are used: the spherical coordinate and the Cartesian coordinate with a uniform rotation. The surface temperature is externally fixed and the troposphere is cooled by the radiation; unstable stratification generates large-scale convective motions.   Dependencies on the surface temperature difference from north to south Delta T_s are investigated. The numerical results show that a systematic multi-cell structure exists in every experiment. If the surface temperature is constant (Delta T_s = 0 ), convective motions are organized in the scale of the Rossby deformation radius and their precipitation patterns have a periodicity of the advective time tau_D. As Delta T_s becomes larger, the organized convective system tends to propagate toward warmer regions.

This model can be considered as belonging to the class of self-organized models which may exhibit spontaneous criticality, with four additional ingredients compared to sandpile models, namely quenched disorder, boundary driving, long range forces and fast time crack rules. In this ''crack'' model, as in the ''dislocation'' version previously studied, we find that the occurrence of repeated earthquakes organizes the activity on well-defined fault-like structures. In contrast with the ''dislocation'' model, after a transient, the time evolution becomes periodic with run-aways ending each cycle. This stems from the ''crack'' stress transfer rule preventing criticality to organize in favor of cyclic behavior. For sufficiently large disorder and weak stress drop, these large events are preceded by a complex space-time history of foreshock activity, characterized by a Gutenberg-Richter power law distribution with universal exponent $B=1 \\\\pm 0.05$. This is similar to a power law distribution of small nucleating droplets before the nucleation of the macroscopic phase in a first-order phase transition.

We reinterpret the same physics as a process of resonant pair tunneling and illustrate it through cooper pair analysis. This interpretation is used to give a mechanism which leads to a singular suppression of $T_c$ as function of c-axis(off plane/axis) disorder. In this mechanism the non resonant tunneling processes arising from the c-axis disorder in general contributes a pair binding energy which is reduced by a factor $\\\\frac{T_J}{\\\\epsilon_F}$, where $T_J$ is the interlayer pair tunneling matrix element and $\\\\epsilon_F$ is the fermi energy. This leads to a simple theorem which states that the scale of $T_c$ is controlled by the space average value of the bare one electron interlayer hoping matrix element. After briefly discussing that the ET and TMTSF molecule based organic superconductors are strongly correlated narrow band systems, the dramatic reduction of $T_c$ by anion disorder in organic superconductors is explained by our mechanism.

Pairs of simulated spectra, extracted from lines of sight separated by distances from D=12.5kpc up to 800kpc, and a ``control sample'' of unrelated lines of sight, are analyzed at redshifts 3, 2, and 1. Coincident line samples are defined for HI column density thresholds of Nco = 10^{12.5}, 10^{13}, and 10^{14} per square cm. We find that: 1) Under the assumption of a single structure size, a Bayesian analysis yields sizes that are larger for smaller Nco, and at fixed Nco the size decreases with decreasing redshift. However, these derived sizes are found to increase with increasing D indicating that the assumption of a single structure size is invalid. 2) The column densities of coincident pairs are highly correlated for small D, with increasing scatter as D is increased, consistent with structures that have a centrally peaked N(HI) that decreases gradually with radius. 3) The velocity difference distribution for coincident lines is very narrow for small D, and widens as D is increased to meet the expectation for chance coincidences in unrelated lines of sight. This behavior is indicative of organized motion within the structures. 4) For small D, the distribution of anticoincident line column densities, Nac, falls steeply as Nac increases from the cutoff value, but has a significant tail at large values which is inconsistent with a population of spherical absorbers with sharp edges, and consistent with a flattened geometry. The conclusions reached on the basis of the DLOS analysis are validated by an examination of the three-dimensional structures and velocity flows in the simulation data.\",\n",
       " 'Understanding the bimodal duration distribution (dynamic range $>$ 10$^{4}$) of $\\\\gamma$-ray bursts is central to determining if the phenomenon is in fact a singular one. A unifying concept, beyond isotropy and inhomogeneity of the two groups separately, is that bursts consist of pulses, organized in time and energy: wider pulses are more asymmetric, their centroids are shifted to later times at lower energies, and shorter, more symmetric pulses tend to be spectrally harder. Long bursts tend to have many pulses while short bursts usually have few, relatively narrow pulses. Two factors, viewing angle and beaming, may account for pulse asymmetry and the large dynamic range ($\\\\sim$ 200) in pulse widths. A cosmological time-dilation signature, with an expected dynamic range of order two, would be difficult to measure against these large intrinsic variations and low signal-to-noise levels of dimmer bursts. Some statistics ($T_{\\\\rm 90}$, pulse intervals) are particularly sensitive to brightness bias, noise, and apparently minor variations in definition. Also, spectral redshift would move narrower, high-energy emission from dim bursts into the band of observation, constituting a countering effect to time dilation.

Since the criticality here emerges from the asymptotic distribution of some quantities, without tuning of parameters, our method is a mapping from a probabilistic cellular automaton with critical behavior to a self organized critical model with the same critical properties.',\n",

       " 'Resummation of large infrared logarithms in perturbation theory can, in certain circumstances, enhance the sensitivity to small gluon momenta and introduce spurious nonperturbative contributions. In particular, different procedures -- equivalent in perturbation theory -- to organize this resummation can differ by $1/Q$ power corrections. The question arises whether one can formulate resummation procedures that are explicitly consistent with the infrared behaviour of finite-order Feynman diagrams.

Our main concern is to characterize those systems that, under the renormalization flow, are driven away from the Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) renormalization group fixed point. We are especially interested in understanding under what circumstances such a system is a Marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) when the dimension of space is greater or equal than 2 . The interacting electron system is analyzed by combining renormalization group (RG) methods with bosonization techniques. The RG calculations are organized as a double expansion in the inverse scale parameter, $\\\\lambda^{-1} ,$ which is proportional to the width of the effective momentum space around the Fermi surface and in the running coupling constant, $ g_\\\\lambda , $ which measures the strength of electron interactions at corresponding energy scales. Excluding a superconducting instability, the system can be analyzed by means of bosonization. The RG and the underlying perturbation expansion in powers of $ \\\\lambda^{-1} $ serve to characterize the approximations involved by bosonizing the system. We argue that systems with short-range interactions flow to the LFL fixed point. Within the approximations involved by bosonization, the same holds for systems with long-range, longitudinal, density-density interactions. For electron systems interacting via long-range, transverse, current-current interactions a deviation from LFL behaviour is possible : the results of the bosonization calculation are consistent with a MFL, if the exponent parametrizing the singularity of the interaction potential in momentum space is greater than or equal to d-1.',\n",
       " 'We present an iterative procedure to build a Chinese language model (LM). We segment Chinese text into words based on a word-based Chinese language model. However, the construction of a Chinese LM itself requires word boundaries. To get out of the chicken-and-egg problem, we propose an iterative procedure that alternates two operations: segmenting text into words and building an LM. Starting with an initial segmented corpus and an LM based upon it, we use a Viterbi-liek algorithm to segment another set of data. Then, we build an LM based on the second set and use the resulting LM to segment again the first corpus. The alternating procedure provides a self-organized way for the segmenter to detect automatically unseen words and correct segmentation errors. Our preliminary experiment shows that the alternating procedure not only improves the accuracy of our segmentation, but discovers unseen words surprisingly well. The resulting word-based LM has a perplexity of 188 for a general Chinese corpus.',\n",

The SAM exhibits the Gutenberg-Richter law with an exponent $\\\\beta$ related to the roughness index of the profiles. Apart from being analytically treatable, the model exhibits a non-trivial clustering in the spatio-temporal distribution of epicenters that strongly resembles the experimentally observed one. A generalized and more realistic version of the model exhibits the Omori scaling for the distribution of the aftershocks. The SAM lies in a different perspective with respect to usual models for seismicity. In this case, in fact, the critical behaviour is not Self-Organized but stems from the fractal geometry of the faults, which, on its turn, is supposed to arise as a consequence of geological processes on very long time scales with respect to the seismic dynamics. The explicit introduction of the fault geometry, as an active element of this complex phenomenology, represents the real novelty of our approach.',\n",

Here we sketch a construction for a gauge-invariant string field action around non-conformal backgrounds. The construction makes no reference to any conformal theory. Its two-dimensional field-theoretic aspect is based on a generalized BRST operator satisfying a set of Weyl descent equations. Its geometric aspect uses a complex of moduli spaces of two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds having ordinary punctures, and organized by the number of special punctures which goes from zero to infinity. In this complex there is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra that includes naturally the operator which adds one special puncture.

We view the medium as consisting of cohesionless hard particles held up by static frictional forces; these are subject to microscopic indeterminacy which corresponds macroscopically to the fact that the equations of stress continuity are incomplete -- no strain variable can be defined. We propose that in general the continuity equations should be closed by means of a constitutive relation (or relations) between different components of the (mesoscopically averaged) stress tensor. The primary constitutive relation relates radial and vertical shear and normal stresses (in two dimensions, this is all one needs). We argue that the constitutive relation(s) should be local, and should encode the construction history of the pile: this history determines the organization of the grains at a mesoscopic scale, and thereby the local relationship between stresses. To the accuracy of published experiments, the pattern of stresses beneath a pile shows a scaling between piles of different heights (RSF scaling) which severely limits the form the constitutive relation can take ...',\n",

We argue however that there is a much simpler explanation for the appearance of a power law in terms of extinctions caused by stresses (either biotic or abiotic) to which species are subjected by their environment.

However, if the organisms are shielded by an absorbing material like carbon, and if ejection takes place in the late-Sun (red-giant) phase of a one-solar-mass star like our Sun, there is a significant probability that these micro-organisms can reach another star system alive (i.e., with only sub-lethal damage from UV and ionizing radiation).

       " 'Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.',\n",

Firstly, the two chains problem of spinless fermions is studied in order to see the behaviour of the band splitting as a function of the exponent $\\\\alpha$ which characterizes the $1D$ Luttinger liquid. Moderate intra-chain interactions can lead to a strong reduction of this splitting. The on-set of the confinement within the individual chains (defined by a vanishing splitting) seems to be governed by $\\\\alpha$.

The former of these features is very difficult to account for if the material possesses three dimensional coherence, while the latter is inconsistent with a description based on a two dimensional fixed point. We therefore present a new proposal for these materials in which they are categorized by a fixed point at which transport in one direction is not renormalization group irrelevant, but is intrinsically incoherent, i.e. the incoherence is present in a pure system, at zero temperature. The defining property of such a state is that single electron coherence is confined to lower dimensional subspaces (planes or chains) so that it is impossible to observe interference effects between histories which involve electrons moving between these subspaces.',\n",

An important feature of these media is the existence of a curve where the local dynamics is effectively period-1. This curve arises as a consequence of the necessity to reconcile the conflict between the global topological organization of the medium induced by the presence of a spiral wave and the topological phase space structure of local orbits determined by the reaction rate law. Due to their general topological nature, the phenomena described here should be observable in a broad class of systems with complex periodic behavior.',\n",

The structures stall their expansion and become static and, as long as the ionization sources and the ambient densities remain about constant, the resulting regions are stable and long lived. For cases with negative density gradients, and depending on the density distribution, some regions never reach the static equilibrium condition.

In particular it is shown that the effective action governing the formation of synaptic connections in models of networks of feature detectors that encorporate Kohonen-like self-organization can spontaneously lead to structures that are topologically nontrivial in both a 2-dimensional and 4-dimensional sense. It is suggested that the appearance of biological neural structures with a nontrivial 4-dimensional topology is the fundamental organizational principle underlying the emergence of advanced cognitive capabilities.',\n",
       " \"When holes are doped into an antiferromagnetic insulator they form a slowly fluctuating array of ``topological defects'' (metallic stripes) in which the motion of the holes exhibits a self-organized quasi one-dimensional electronic character. The accompanying lateral confinement of the intervening Mott-insulating regions induces a spin gap or pseudogap in the environment of the stripes. We present a theory of underdoped high temperature superconductors and show that there is a {\\\\it local} separation of spin and charge, and that the mobile holes on an individual stripe acquire a spin gap via pair hopping between the stripe and its environment; i.e. via a magnetic analog of the usual superconducting proximity effect. In this way a high pairing scale without a large mass renormalization is established despite the strong Coulomb repulsion between the holes. Thus the {\\\\it mechanism} of pairing is the generation of a spin gap in spatially-confined {\\\\it Mott-insulating} regions of the material in the proximity of the metallic stripes. At non-vanishing stripe densities, Josephson coupling between stripes produces a dimensional crossover to a state with long-range superconducting phase coherence. This picture is established by obtaining exact and well-controlled approximate solutions of a model of a one-dimensional electron gas in an active environment. An extended discussion of the experimental evidence supporting the relevance of these results to the cuprate superconductors is given.\",\n",

       " 'A new, very different physical model of the universe is proposed. Its virtues include unifying relativity and quantum mechanics, and particles with de Broglie waves. It also appears to provide a truly unified physical basis for electromagnetic, gravitational and nuclear forces. The basic system is a four-dimensional Euclidean space, containing an array of nonlinear \"flow\" waves. These repeat in one dimension, called [phi]. As in Newtonian mechanics, time is treated as an additional, unidirectional parameter describing the evolution of the system. Nevertheless, this wave system is shown be inherently relativistic. Further self-organizing patterns arise within the overall wave structure. Called \"wavicles,\" these have intrinsic quantized fields, \"spin,\" and rest energy, and represent elementary particles. Relativistic expressions are derived for particle behavior in scalar, vector and gravitational potentials. Proper representations of these potentials, based on the wave fields and associated [phi] flows of wavicles, are also obtained. As in the causal quantum mechanics of de Broglie and Bohm, wavicles exist continuously and follow definite, stochastic trajectories. Although experimentally equivalent to Einstein\\'s special relativity, this theory differs fundamentally from his general relativity and the associated Big Bang model. According to Linde, the latter predict a large-scale space-time curvature roughly 60 orders of magnitude greater than observed values.

The resulting images reveal a \"froth\" of superposed filaments, voids, and shells. This fine-scale structure extends all the way down to the Galactic midplane. Moreover, it scales in intensity with the smoothly varying background, independent of latitude, thus indicating that the fine-scale residual emission is co-extensive with the smooth background. We conclude that the fine-scale structure is not merely of local origin, but consists of both nearby and more distant features in the disk. Although we had expected to find morphological evidence for supernova-driven \"worms\" or \"chimneys\" rooted in the Galactic plane, our processing shows the FIR fine-scale structure to be more complex (e.g. less coherent and less rooted) as viewed in projection. Analysis of the spatial statistics shows that the FIR fine-scale structure is self-similar with a spatial power-law exponent of -3 and a fractal dimension of 2.5 --- similar behavior to that found in isolated cirrus and molecular clouds. On scales larger than 1.5 deg, the power-law exponent flattens to -2.5, perhaps indicating a change in the characteristic structure.

The dynamics of Alfven waves is sensitive to the sense of polarization as well as the angle of propagation with respect to the ambient magnetic field.

Parallel propagating circularly polarized packets evolve to a few circularly polarized Alfven harmonics on large scales. Stationary arc-polarized rotational discontinuities form from obliquely propagating waves. Collisional dissipation, even if weak, introduces enhanced wave damping when beta is very close to unity.

We argue that punctuated equilibria reflects the tendency of dynamical systems to evolve towards a critical state, and review recent work on simple models. A good metaphoric picture is one where the systems are temporarily trapped in valleys of deformable, interacting landscapes. Similarities with spin glasses are pointed out. Punctuated equilibria are essential for the emergence of complex phenomena.

       " 'We propose a neural network model with transient chaos, or a transiently chaotic neural network (TCNN) as an approximation method for combinatorial optimization problem, by introducing transiently chaotic dynamics into neural networks. Unlike conventional neural networks only with point attractors, the proposed neural network has richer and more flexible dynamics, so that it can be expected to have higher ability of searching for globally optimal or near-optimal solutions. A significant property of this model is that the chaotic neurodynamics is temporarily generated for searching and self-organizing, and eventually vanishes with autonomous decreasing of a bifurcation parameter corresponding to the \"temperature\" in usual annealing process. Therefore, the neural network gradually approaches, through the transient chaos, to dynamical structure similar to such conventional models as the Hopfield neural network which converges to a stable equilibrium point. Since the optimization process of the transiently chaotic neural network is similar to simulated annealing, not in a stochastic way but in a deterministically chaotic way, the new method is regarded as chaotic simulated annealing (CSA). Fundamental characteristics of the transiently chaotic neurodynamics are numerically investigated with examples of a single neuron model and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Moreover, a maintenance scheduling problem for generators in a practical power system is also analysed to verify practical efficiency of this new method.',\n",

We suggest that the MTs are the microsites in the brain, for the emergence of stable, macroscopic quantum coherent states, identifiable with the ``preconscious states''. Quantum space-time effects, as described by non-critical string theory, trigger then an ``organized collapse'' of the coherent states down to a specific or ``conscious state''. The whole process we estimate to take O(1 sec), in excellent agreement with a plethora of experimental/observational findings. The complete integrability of the stringy model for MT proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory coding and capacity.

This new exponent characterizes a non-stationary regime that has not been previously considered in the context of self-organized criticality.',\n",

       " \"A number of authors have in recent years proposed that the processes of macroevolution may give rise to self-organized critical phenomena which could have a significant effect on the dynamics of ecosystems. In particular it has been suggested that mass extinction may arise through a purely biotic mechanism as the result of so-called coevolutionary avalanches. In this paper we first explore the empirical evidence which has been put forward in favor of this conclusion. The data center principally around the existence of power-law functional forms in the distribution of the sizes of extinction events and other quantities. We then propose a new mathematical model of mass extinction which does not rely on coevolutionary effects and in which extinction is caused entirely by the action of environmental stresses on species. In combination with a simple model of species adaptation we show that this process can account for all the observed data without the need to invoke coevolution and critical processes. The model also makes some independent predictions, such as the existence of ``aftershock'' extinctions in the aftermath of large mass extinction events, which should in theory be testable against the fossil record.\",\n",

       " 'We present analysis of the light curve from the ROSAT HRI monitoring observations of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 390.3. Observed every three days for about 9 months, this is the first well sampled X-ray light curve on these time scales. The flares and quiescent periods in the light curve suggest that the variability is nonlinear, and a statistical test yields a detection with >6 sigma confidence. The structure function has a steep slope ~0.7, while the periodogram is much steeper with a slope ~2.6, with the difference partially due to a linear trend in the data. The non-stationary character of the light curve could be evidence that the variability power spectrum has not turned over to low frequencies, or it could be an essential part of the nonlinear process. Evidence for X-ray reprocessing suggests that the X-ray emission is not from the compact radio jet, and the reduced variability before and after flares suggests there cannot be two components contributing to the X-ray short term variability. Thus, these results cannot be explained easily by simple models for AGN variability, including shot noise which may be associated with flares in disk-corona models or active regions on a rotating disk, because in those models the events are independent and the variability is therefore linear. The character of the variability is similar to that seen in Cygnus X-1, which has been explained by a reservoir or self-organized criticality model. Inherently nonlinear, this model can reproduce the reduced variability before and after large flares and the steep PDS seen generally from AGN. The 3C 390.3 light curve presented here is the first support for such models to explain AGN variability on intermediate time scales from a few days to months.',\n",

       " \"We examine a general framework for visualizing datasets of high (> 2) dimensionality, and demonstrate it using the morphology of galaxies at moderate redshifts. The distributions of various populations of such galaxies are examined in a space spanned by four purely morphological parameters. Galaxy images are taken from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) in the I band (F814W). Since we have little prior knowledge on how galaxies are distributed in morphology space we use an unsupervised learning method (a variant of Kohonen's Self Organizing Maps, or SOMs). This method allows the data to organize themselves onto a two-dimensional space while conserving most of the topology of the original space. It thus enables us to visualize the distribution of galaxies and study it more easily. The process is fully automated, does not rely on any kind of eyeball classification and is readily applicable to large numbers of images. We apply it to a sample of 2934 galaxies, and find that morphology correlates well with the apparent magnitude distribution and to lesser extents with color and bulge dominance. The resulting map traces a morphological sequence similar to the Hubble Sequence, albeit two dimensional. We use the SOM as a diagnostic tool, and rediscover a population of bulge-dominated galaxies with morphologies characteristic of peculiar galaxies. This is achieved without recourse to eyeball classification. We also examine the effect of noise on the resulting SOM, and conclude that down to I magnitude of 24 our results are reliable. We propose using this method as a framework into which more physical data can be incorporated when they become available.

Invoking quasar outflows, we argue that both thermal and kinematic decrements can be produced by the baryons swept up by the mechanical luminosity of quasars. In contrast to the case of decrements produced by the hot electrons confined within the cluster potential, the magnitude of these quasar-outflow induced effects depend primarily on the luminosity of the QSO, and the physical scale of the outflow - which in turn depends both on the mean local density and the density gradient in the vicinity of the quasar.

Groups are much gas-poor compared to clusters, and appear instead to have shed a major fraction of their original cosmic share of baryons, which indicates that galaxy clusters cannot have formed by assembling groups similar to the present day ones. It is argued that this favors low-$\\\\Omega$ universes, in which the growth of rich clusters is virtually complete at high redshifts. It is also argued that elemental abundance ratios in clusters are nearly solar, which is consistent with a similar proportion of supernovae of Type Ia and Type II having enriched both the solar neghborhood as well clusters as a whole. Much of the iron in clusters appears to reside in the intracluster medium rather than inside galaxies.

       " 'It is often assumed that galaxies cannot generate large-scale coherent star- forming activity without some organizing agent, such as spiral density waves, bars, large-scale instabilities, or external perturbations due to encounters with other galaxies. We present simulations of a simple model of star formation in which local spatial couplings lead to large-scale coherent, and even synchronized, patterns of star formation without any explicit propagation or any separate organizing agent. At a given location, star formation is assumed to occur when the gas velocity dispersion falls below a critical value dependent on the density. Young stars inject energy into the gas in their neighborhood, increasing the velocity dispersion and inhibiting the instability. A dissipation function continually \"cools\" the gas. The stability of this local inhibitory feedback model is examined both analytically and numerically. A large number of two-dimensional simulations are used to examine the effect of spatial couplings due to energy injection into neighboring regions. We find that several distinct types of behavior can be demarcated in a phase diagram whose parameter axes are the density (assumed constant in most models) and spatial coupling strength. These \"phases\" include, with decreasing density, a spatially homogeneous steady state, oscillatory \"islands,\" traveling waves of star formation or global synchronization, and scattered \"patches\" of star formation activity.

       " 'The overall spectra (SED) of blazars, from radio to gamma-ray energies, seem to obey well defined trends, with a continuity of properties between blazars of different classes. To quantify this statement we can either investigate their observed properties (see Fossati et al., this volume), or try to determine their intrinsic physical parameters by applying specific models, and trying to fit their SED. Results of the latter approach are reported here. We applied simple, one-zone, homogeneous models to all blazars strongly detected in the gamma-ray band, assuming or not the presence of seed (for the inverse Compton process) photons produced outside the active region. Our results suggest that the SEDs of blazars are ruled by the amount of radiative cooling suffered by the electrons producing most of the emission. In turn, the amount of cooling is ruled by the amount of the external photon emission, which can be identified with radiation coming from the broad line clouds. Blazar SEDs are therefore organized in a sequence: objects with no or very weak emission lines (X-ray selected BL Lacs, or HBL) are characterized by very high electron energies and a Compton luminosity of the same order of the synchrotron one. These are TeV sources. BL Lacertae objects selected in the radio band (or LBL) are characterized by smaller electron energies, more total power and more line luminosity, and by a larger ratio of the Compton to synchrotron luminosity. They are GeV sources. Increasing the total intrinsic power and the line emission luminosity, we have smaller still electron energies (more cooling) and greater still Compton to synchrotron power ratio.

Our model is equivalent to the Halperin-Lee-Read $\\\\nu = 1/2$ Hamiltonian with an ultraviolet cutoff $\\\\Lambda$ for the gauge fields, and we expand our answer in powers of $\\\\Lambda / k_F$, assuming it is small. In this definition the effective mass depends only on the gauge-invariant density and current response functions of the system. Within RPA, this definition yields a finite result for the effective mass in our model. We also comment on corrections to this effective mass formula when processes beyond RPA are included. Finally, we comment briefly on the observation that organizing the perturbation expansion in powers of $\\\\Lambda / k_F$ is a way to systematically study the physics beyond RPA.',\n",

       " 'In the last years there has been a growing interest in the understanding a vast variety of scale invariant and critical phenomena occurring in nature. Experiments and observations indeed suggest that many physical systems develop spontaneously correlations with power law behaviour both in space and time. Pattern formation, aggregation phenomena, biological systems, geological systems, disordered materials, clustering of matter in the universe are just some of the fields in which scale invariance has been observed as a common and basic feature. However, the fact that certain structures exhibit fractal and complex properties does not tell us why this happens. A crucial point to understand is therefore the origin of the general scale-invariance of natural phenomena. This would correspond to the understanding of the origin of fractal structures and of the properties of Self- Organized Criticality (SOC) from the knowledge of the microscopic physical processes at the basis of these phenomena. Fractal geometry can play a crucial role in extracting the correct physical properties from experimental data. In particular, the recent availability of complete three dimensional samples of galaxies and clusters permits a direct study of their spatial properties. We present a brief review of galaxy correlations based on the methods of modern Statistical Physics. These methods are able to identify self-similar and non-analytical properties, and allow us to test the usual homogeneity assumption of luminous matter distribution.   The new analysis shows that all the available data are consistent with each other and show fractal correlations (with dimension $D \\\\simeq 2$) up to the deepest scales probed until now ($1000 \\\\hmp$)',\n",

Our decomposition can be used to organize complicated higher-order and higher-twist contributions in the study of the virtual Compton scattering off the proton.

At high temperatures we argue that transport is governed by inelastic scattering whereas at low temperatures the conductance decays exponentially with the electron dephasing length. The crossover between these regimes occurs at the temperature at which the elastic and inelastic scattering times become equal. This model is shown to be in quantitative agreement with the organic conductor $TTT_2I_{3-\\\\delta}$. Within this model, we also show that on the insulating side, the positive magnetoresistance of the form $(H/T)^2$ observed in $TTT_2I_{3-\\\\delta}$ and other quasi-1D conductors can be explained by the role spin-flip scattering plays in the electron dephasing rate.',\n",

We derive a precise localization (3 arcmin radius) and fast broad band (2-700 keV) spectral evolution of the event. A search in the catalogues at all wavelengths in the error box yields a unique outstanding source: the bright radio quasar 4C 49.29. Although the probability of finding such a source by chance is very low (0.0002), the absence of similar counterparts in other small error boxes suggests a chance occurrence. We also find that the duration-energy relationship for bursts previously observed above 25keV (Fenimore et al. 1995) extends down to 1.5 keV. This result suggests that the same radiation mechanism is operating from X-rays to gamma-rays and is in agreement with radiative cooling by synchotron emission. A fast evolution of the spectrum is found, in which the ratio of X- to gamma-ray intensities varies over three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the spectrum in the initial phase of the event betrays the presence of an optically thick source rapidly evolving in a thin configuration.No other class of sources in the universe shows such a fast and extreme evolution. These results pose new and tighter constraints on theoretical models for gamma-ray bursts.',\n",

The observed complex price fluctuations guide and constraint our theoretical understanding of agent interactions and of the organization of the market. The gaussian paradigm of independent normally distributed price increments has long been known to be incorrect with many attempts to improve it. Econometric nonlinear autoregressive models with conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and their generalizations capture only imperfectly the volatility correlations and the fat tails of the probability distribution function (pdf) of price variations. Moreover, as far as changes in time scales are concerned, the so-called ``aggregation'' properties of these models are not easy to control. More recently, the leptokurticity of the full pdf was described by a truncated ``additive'' L\\\\'evy flight model (TLF). Alternatively, Ghashghaie et al. proposed an analogy between price dynamics and hydrodynamic turbulence. In this letter, we use wavelets to decompose the volatility of intraday (S&P500) return data across scales. We show that when investigating two-points correlation functions of the volatility logarithms across different time scales, one reveals the existence of a causal information cascade from large scales (i.e. small frequencies, hence to vocable ``infrared'') to fine scales (``ultraviolet''). We quantify and visualize the information flux across scales. We provide a possible interpretation of our findings in terms of market dynamics.\",\n",

       " \"In genetic systems there is a non-trivial interface between the sequence of symbols which constitutes the chromosome, or ``genotype'', and the products which this sequence encodes --- the ``phenotype''. This interface can be thought of as a ``computer''. In this case the chromosome is viewed as an algorithm and the phenotype as the result of the computation. In general only a small fraction of all possible sequences of symbols makes any sense for a given computer. The difficulty of finding meaningful algorithms by random mutation is known as the brittleness problem. In this paper we show that mutation and crossover favour the emergence of an algorithmic language which facilitates the production of meaningful sequences following random mutations of the genotype. We base our conclusions on an analysis of the population dynamics of a variant of Kitano's neurogenetic model wherein the chromosome encodes the rules for cellular division and the phenotype is a 16-cell organism interpreted as a connectivity matrix for a feedforward neural network. We show that an algorithmic language emerges, describe this language in extenso, and show how it helps to solve the brittleness problem.\",\n",

       " 'The gross features of the observed baryon excitation spectrum below 2 GeV are well explained if the spectrum generating algebra of its intrinsic orbital angular momentum states is o(4)*su(2)_I. The spins of the resonances are obtained through the coupling of a Lorentz bi-spinor (1/2,0)+ (0,1/ 2) to a multiplet of the type (j,j) in its O(4)/O(3) reduction. The parities of the resonances follow from those of the O(3) members of the (j,j) multiplets. In this way relativistic SL(2,C) representations are constructed. For example, the first S11, P11, and D13 states with masses around 1500 MeV fit into the (1/2, 1/2)* [(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] representation. The observed parities of the resonances correspond to natural parities of the (1/2,1/2) states. The second P11, S11, D13- together with the first P13, F15, D15, and (a predicted) F17 -resonances, centered around 1700 MeV, are organized into the (3/2,3/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] representation. I argue that the members of the (3/2,3/2) multiplet carry unnatural parities and that in this region chiral symmetry is restored. In the N(939)- N(1650) transition the chiral symmetry mode is changed, and therefore, a chiral phase transition is predicted to take place.',\n",
       " \"Jets and pulsar-fed supernova remnants (plerions) tend to develop highly organized toroidal magnetic field. Such a field structure could explain the polarization properties of some jets, and contribute to their lateral confinement. A toroidal field geometry is also central to models for the Crab Nebula - the archetypal plerion - and leads to the deduction that the Crab pulsar's wind must have a weak magnetic field. Yet this `Z-pinch' field configuration is well known to be locally unstable, even when the magnetic field is weak and/or boundary conditions slow or suppress global modes. Thus, the magnetic field structures imputed to the interiors of jets and plerions are unlikely to persist.   To demonstrate this, I present a local analysis of Z-pinch instabilities for relativistic fluids in the ideal MHD limit. Kink instabilities dominate, destroying the concentric field structure and probably driving the system toward a more chaotic state in which the mean field strength is independent of radius (and in which resistive dissipation of the field may be enhanced). I estimate the timescales over which the field structure is likely to be rearranged and relate these to distances along relativistic jets and radii from the central pulsar in a plerion.   I conclude that a concentric toroidal field is unlikely to exist well outside the Crab pulsar's wind termination shock. There is thus no dynamical reason to conclude that the magnetic energy flux carried by the pulsar wind is much weaker than the kinetic energy flux. Abandoning this inference would resolve a long-standing puzzle in pulsar wind theory.\",\n",

       " \"Simulations on a Lennard-Jones computer glass are performed to study effects arising from defects in glasses at low temperatures. The numerical analysis reveals that already a low concentration of defects may dramatically change the low temperature properties by giving rise to extrinsic double-well potentials (DWP's). The main characteristics of these extrinsic DWP's are (i) high barrier heights, (ii) high probability that a defect is indeed connected with an extrinsic DWP, (iii) highly localized dynamics around this defect, and (iv) smaller deformation potential coupling to phonons. Designing an extension of the Standard Tunneling Model (STM) which parametrizes this picture and comparing with ultrasound experiments on the wet network glass $a$-B$_2$O$_3$ shows that effects of OH-impurities are accurately accounted for. This model is then applied to organic polymer glasses and proteins. It is suggested that side groups may act similarly like doped impurities inasmuch as extrinsic DWP's are induced, which possess a distribution of barriers peaked around a high barrier height. This compares with the structurlessly distributed barrier heights of the intrinsic DWP's, which are associated with the backbone dynamics. It is shown that this picture is consistent with elastic measurements on polymers, and can explain anomalous nonlogarithmic line broadening recently observed in hole burning experiments in PMMA.\",\n",

Following we investigate the highly organized and structured distribution of turning points. The turning point dynamics is discussed and the corresponding turning point map which possesses an appealing asymptotic scaling property is investigated. Strong correlations are shown to exist for the turning point trajectories which contain the information of the fixed points as well as the stability coefficients of the dynamical system. For the more specialized case of symmetric maps which possess a symmetric density we derive universal statistical properties of the corresponding turning point dynamics. Using the turning point concept we finally develop a method for the analysis of (one dimensional) time series.',\n",
       " \"We present a detailed discussion of both theoretical and experimental evidence in favour of the existence of states of ``confined coherence'' in metals of sufficiently high anisotropy and with sufficiently strong correlations. The defining property of such a state is that single electron coherence is confined to lower dimensional subspaces (planes or chains) so that it is impossible to observe interference effects between histories which involve electrons moving between these subspaces. The most dramatic experimental manifestation of such a state is the coexistence of incoherent, non-metallic transport in one or two directions with coherent transport in at least one other direction. The magnitude of the Fermi surface warping due to transverse (inter-subspace) momentum plays the role of an order parameter (in a state of confined coherence, this order parameter vanishes) and the effect can occur in a pure system at zero temperature..... ..anomalous transport data in the (normal state of the) cuprate superconductors and in the low temperature, metallic state of the highly anisotropic organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$ cannot be understood within a Fermi liquid framework, and, we argue, the only plausible way to understand that transport is in terms of a state of confined coherence.\",\n",
       " \"We present a unified mean-field theory, based on the single site approximation to the master-equation, for stochastic self-organized critical models. In particular, we analyze in detail the properties of sandpile and forest-fire (FF) models. In analogy with other non-equilibrium critical phenomena, we identify the order parameter with the density of ``active'' sites and the control parameters with the driving rates. Depending on the values of the control parameters, the system is shown to reach a subcritical (absorbing) or super-critical (active) stationary state. Criticality is analyzed in terms of the singularities of the zero-field susceptibility. In the limit of vanishing control parameters, the stationary state displays scaling characteristic of self-organized criticality (SOC). We show that this limit corresponds to the breakdown of space-time locality in the dynamical rules of the models. We define a complete set of critical exponents, describing the scaling of order parameter, response functions, susceptibility and correlation length in the subcritical and supercritical states. In the subcritical state, the response of the system to small perturbations takes place in avalanches. We analyze their scaling behavior in relation with branching processes. In sandpile models because of conservation laws, a critical exponents subset displays mean-field values ($\\\\nu=1/2$ and $\\\\gamma = 1$) in any dimensions. We treat bulk and boundary dissipation and introduce a new critical exponent relating dissipation and finite size effects. We present numerical simulations that confirm our results.

Within a strong electron-electron correlation approximation, the exciton properties are extensively studied. Using scattering theory, we analytically obtain the exciton energy and wavefunction and derive a criterion for the existence of a $B_u$ exciton. We also systematically investigate the effect of impurities on the coherent motion of an exciton. The coherence is measured by a suitably defined electron-hole correlation function. It is shown that, for impurities with an on-site potential, a crossover behavior will occur if the impurity strength is comparable to the bandwidth of the exciton, corresponding to exciton localization. For a charged impurity with a spatially extended potential, in addition to localization the exciton will dissociate into an uncorrelated electron-hole pair when the impurity is sufficiently strong to overcome the Coulomb interaction which binds the electron-hole pair. Interchain coupling effects are also discussed by considering two polymer chains coupled through nearest-neighbor interchain hopping $t_{\\\\perp}$ and interchain Coulomb interaction $V_{\\\\perp}$. Within the $t$ matrix scattering formalism, for every center-of-mass momentum, we find two poles determined only by $V_{\\\\perp}$, which correspond to the interchain excitons.

Approximately 75 participants with wide ranging interests attended the workshop. An even larger community helped through extensive on-line debates prior to the meeting. Each of the several sessions, organized mostly around chronological labels, also addressed some underlying, general physical themes: How are SNR dynamics and structures modified by the character of the CSM and the ISM and vice versa? How are magnetic fields generated in SNRs and how do magnetic fields influence SNRs? Where and how are cosmic-rays (electrons and ions) produced in SNRs and how does their presence influence or reveal SNR dynamics?

For a simple model system containing one nanoscale metallic cluster connected by molecular links to two bulk metallic electrodes we show that self-excitation of periodic cluster oscillations in conjunction with sequential processes of cluster charging and decharging appears for a sufficiently large bias voltage. This new `electron shuttle' mechanism of discrete charge transfer gives rise to a current through the nanostructure, which is proportional to the cluster vibration frequency.\",\n",
       " 'Mixing of two fractions of a granular material in a slowly rotating two-dimensional drum is considered. The rotation is around the axis of the upright drum. The drum is filled partially, and mixing occurs only at a free surface of the material. We propose a simple theory of the mixing process which describes a real experiment surprisingly well. A geometrical approach without appealing to ideas of self-organized criticality is used. The dependence of the mixing time on the drum filling is calculated. The mixing time is infinite in the case of the half-filled drum. We describe singular behaviour of the mixing near this critical point.',\n",
       " 'The question addressed in this paper is: What originates pure spin superradiance in a polarized spin system placed inside a resonator? The term \"pure\" means that no initial coherence is imposed on spins, and its appearance manifests a purely self-organized collective effect. The consideration is based on a microscopic model with dipole spin interactions. An accurate solution of evolution equations is given. The results show that the resonator Nyquist noise does not play, contrary to the common belief, any role in starting spin superradiance, but the emergence of the latter is initiated by local spin fluctuations. The decisive role of nonsecular dipole interactions is stressed.',\n",

       " 'We explore the connection between self-organized criticality and phase transitions in models with absorbing states. Sandpile models are found to exhibit criticality only when a pair of relevant parameters - dissipation epsilon and driving field h - are set to their critical values. The critical values of epsilon and h are both equal to zero. The first is due to the absence of saturation (no bound on energy) in the sandpile model, while the second result is common to other absorbing-state transitions. The original definition of the sandpile model places it at the point (epsilon=0, h=0+): it is critical by definition. We argue power-law avalanche distributions are a general feature of models with infinitely many absorbing configurations, when they are subject to slow driving at the critical point. Our assertions are supported by simulations of the sandpile at epsilon=h=0 and fixed energy density (no drive, periodic boundaries), and of the slowly-driven pair contact process. We formulate a field theory for the sandpile model, in which the order parameter is coupled to a conserved energy density, which plays the role of an effective creation rate.',\n",

In addition a global constraint on the energy contained in the lattice is imposed. In the limit of an infinitely slow driving of the system, the conserved energy $E$ becomes the only parameter governing the dynamical behavior of the system. Both models show scale free behavior at a critical value $E_c$ of the fixed energy. The scaling with respect to the relevant scaling field points out that the developing of critical correlations is in a different universality class than self-organized critical sandpiles. Despite this difference, the activity (avalanche) probability distributions appear to coincide with the one of the standard self-organized critical sandpile.',\n",

       " 'The scattering problems of a scalar point particle from a finite assembly of n>1 non-overlapping and disconnected hard disks, fixed in the two-dimensional plane, belong to the simplest realizations of classically hyperbolic scattering systems. Here, we investigate the connection between the spectral properties of the quantum-mechanical scattering matrix and its semiclassical equivalent based on the semiclassical zeta-function of Gutzwiller and Voros. Our quantum-mechanical calculation is well-defined at every step, as the on-shell T-matrix and the multiscattering kernel M-1 are shown to be trace-class. The multiscattering determinant can be organized in terms of the cumulant expansion which is the defining prescription for the determinant over an infinite, but trace-class matrix. The quantum cumulants are then expanded by traces which, in turn, split into quantum itineraries or cycles. These can be organized by a simple symbolic dynamics. The semiclassical reduction of the coherent multiscattering part takes place on the level of the quantum cycles. We show that the semiclassical analog of the m-th quantum cumulant is the m-th curvature term of the semiclassical zeta function. In this way quantum mechanics naturally imposes the curvature regularization structured by the topological (not the geometrical) length of the pertinent periodic orbits onto the semiclassical zeta function. However, since the cumulant limit m->infinity and the semiclassical limit hbar->0 do not commute in general, the semiclassical analog of the quantum multiscattering determinant is a curvature expanded, truncated semiclassical zeta function. We relate the order of this truncation to the topological entropy of the corresponding classical system.',\n",

Within the framework of the quantized nesting model, we show that umklapp processes may naturally explain sign reversals of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) observed in these conductors. Moreover, umklapp scattering can change the polarization of the spin-density wave (SDW) from linear (sinusoidal SDW) to circular (helicoidal SDW). The QHE vanishes in the helicoidal phases, but a magnetoelectric effect appears. These two characteristic properties may be utilized to detect the magnetic-field-induced helicoidal SDW phases experimentally.',\n",
       " 'We introduce the Webworld model, which links together the ecological modelling of food web structure with the evolutionary modelling of speciation and extinction events. The model describes dynamics of ecological communities on an evolutionary timescale. Species are defined as sets of characteristic features, and these features are used to determine interaction scores between species. A simple rule is used to transfer resources from the external environment through the food web to each of the species, and to determine mean population sizes. A time step in the model represents a speciation event. A new species is added with features similar to those of one of the existing species and a new food web structure is then calculated. The new species may (i) add stably to the web, (ii) become extinct immediately because it is poorly adapted, or (iii) cause one or more other species to become extinct due to competition for resources. We measure various properties of the model webs and compare these with data on real food webs. These properties include the proportions of basal, intermediate and top species, the number of links per species and the number of trophic levels. We also study the evolutionary dynamics of the model ecosystem by following the fluctuations in the total number of species in the web. Extinction avalanches occur when novel organisms arise which are significantly better adapted than existing ones. We discuss these results in relation to the observed extinction events in the fossil record, and to the theory of self-organized criticality.',\n",
       " 'Compact plasmas, that exist near black-hole candidates and in gamma ray burst sources, commonly exhibit self-organized non-linear behavior. A model that simulates the non-linear behavior of compact radiative plasmas is constructed directly from the observed luminosity and variability. The simulation shows that such plasmas self organize, and that the degree of non-linearity as well as the slope of the power density spectrum increase with compactness. The simulation is based on a cellular automaton table that includes the properties of the hot (relativistic) plasmas, and the magnitude of the energy perturbations. The plasmas cool or heat up, depending on whether they release more or less than the energy of a single perturbation. The energy release depends on the plasmas densities and temperatures, and the perturbations energy. Strong perturbations may cool the previously heated plasma through shocks and/or pair creation.   New observations of some active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursters are consistent with the simulation',\n",

The optical conductivity has two features: a narrow mode at zero frequency, with a small spectral weight, and a mode centered around 200 cm^{-1}, with nearly all of the spectral weight expected for the relevant number of carriers and single particle bandmass. We argue that these features are characteristic of a nearly one-dimensional half- or quarter-filled band with Coulomb correlations, and evaluate the finite energy mode in terms of a one-dimensional Mott insulator. At high frequencies (\\\\hbar\\\\omega > t_\\\\perp, the transfer integral perpendicular to the chains), the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity \\\\sigma_1(\\\\omega) is in agreement with calculations based on an interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, and is different from what is expected for an uncorrelated one-dimensional semiconductor.

Using the spatial constancy of $U$, one can find the field profiles $B(x)$, formulate a semi-analytical approach to the creep problem and generalize the logarithmic solution for flux creep, obtained for $U=U(j)$, to the case of essential dependence of $U$ on $B$. This approach is useful for the analysis of dynamic formation of an anomalous magnetization curve (''fishtail''). We analyze the quality of the logarithmic and generalized logarithmic approximations and show that the latter predicts a maximum in the creep rate at short times, which has been observed experimentally.

Applying a magnetic field reduces the effective dimensionality of the system and switches the temperature dependence of resistivity between the insulating and metallic laws depending on the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field. We critically analyze whether various microscopic models suggested in literature can produce such a behavior and find that none of the models is fully satisfactory.

These materials are particularly interesting because of similarities to the high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors including unconventional metallic properties and competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. The temperature dependence of electrical transport, optical, and nuclear magnetic resonance properties deviate significantly from those of a conventional metal. In particular, there appears to be an effective Fermi energy of the order of 100 K which is an order of magnitude smaller than predicted by band structure calculations. The results of quantum chemistry calculations suggest that a minimal theoretical model that can describe these materials is a Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice with one electron per site. Appropriate parameter values for the model imply that the electronic correlations are strong, significant magnetic frustration is present, and the system is close to a metal-insulator transition. Insight into the physics of this model can be obtained from recent studies of the Hubbard model using a dynamical mean-field approximation. They are consistent with a low effective Fermi energy and the unconventional temperature dependence of many of the properties of the metallic phase.

The ``Goldstone modes'' associated with this ``spontaneously broken rotational symmetry'' are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction. These ``Goldstone modes'' mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an $n = d$ component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions $d > 4$, the long distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory. For $d < 4$, non-linear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in $d = 2$, where we can calculate the scaling exponents \\\\underline{exactly}, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in $d = 2$ (the ``Mermin-Wagner'' theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks.\",\n",

       " \"(Abridged) Although both Warm (WNM, 10^4 K) and Cool (CNM, about 100 K) atomic phases coexist in many environments, the dominant mass contribution within a galaxy's star-forming disk (R_25) is that of the CNM. Mass fractions of 60 to 90% are found within R_25, in the form of moderately opaque filaments with a face-on surface covering factor 15%. The kinetic temperature of the CNM increases systematically with galactocentric radius, from some 50 to 200 K, as expected for a radially declining thermal pressure in the galaxy mid-plane. Galaxies of different Hubble type form a nested distribution in T_K(R), apparently due to the mean differences in pressure which result from the different stellar and gas surface densities. The opaque CNM disappears abruptly near R_25, where the low thermal pressure can no longer support the condensed atomic phase. The CNM is apparently a prerequisite for star formation. Median line profiles of the CNM display an extremely narrow line core (FWHM about 6 km/s) together with broad Lorentzian wings (FWHM about 30 km/s). The line core is consistent with only opacity broadening of a thermal profile. The spatial distribution of CNM linewidths is not random. High linewidths occur in distinct shell-like structures with diameter of 100's of pc to kpc's, which show some correlation with diffuse H-alpha shells. The primary source of ``turbulent'' linewidth in the atomic ISM appears to be organized motions due to localized energy injection on a scale of a few 100 pc.\",\n",

The specialization at the level of the microscopic degrees of freedom, and diversity at the level of the system as a whole are phenomena that appear during the course of evolution of the system. We present a mathematical model to describe these evolutionary phenomena in economic communities. The model is a generalization of the replicator equation. The economic motivation for the model and its relationship with some other game theoretic models applied to ecology and sociobiology is discussed. Some results about the attractors of this dynamical system are described. We argue that while the microscopic variables -- the agents comprising the community -- act locally and independently, time evolution produces a collective behaviour in the system characterized by individual specialization of the agents as well as global diversity in the community. This occurs for generic values of the parameters and initial conditions provided the community is sufficiently large, and can be viewed as a kind of self-organization in the system. The context dependence of acceptable innovations in the community appears naturally in this framework.',\n",

Results from a numerical model of the turbulent ISM at large scales suggest that the phase-like appearance of the medium, the typical values of the densities and magnetic field strengths in the intercloud medium, as well as the velocity dispersion-size scaling relation in clouds may be understood as consequences of the interstellar turbulence. However, the density-size relation appears to only hold for the densest clouds, suggesting that low-column density clouds, which are hardest to observe, are turbulent transients. We then explore some properties of highly compressible polytropic turbulence, in one and several dimensions, applicable to molecular cloud scales. At low values of the polytropic index $\\\\gamma$, turbulence may induce the gravitational collapse of otherwise linearly stable clouds, except if they are magnetically subcritical.

The computational simulations presented yield many realistic results that can be compared with video films of pedestrian crowds. Especially, they show the self-organization of collective behavioural patterns.   By assuming that pedestrians tend to choose routes that are frequently taken the above model can be extended to an active walker model of trail formation. The topological structure of the evolving trail network will depend on the disadvantage of building new trails and the durability of existing trails. Computer simulations of trail formation indicate to be a valuable tool for designing systems of ways which satisfy the needs of pedestrians best. An example is given for a non-directed trail network.',\n",

In this paper it is shown that the recently proposed volcanogenic dark matter model can explain this puzzling characteristic of these extinctions. The accumulation and annihilation of dark matter in the center of the Earth due to the passage of a clump leads to excess heat generation with the consequent ejection of superplumes, followed by massive volcanism and attendant mass extinctions. This is preceded by an extinction pulse due to carcinogenesis arising from the direct interaction of the clumped dark matter with living organisms.',\n",

       " \"The amoeboid organism, the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, behaves on the basis of spatio-temporal pattern formation by local contraction-oscillators. This biological system can be regarded as a reaction-diffusion system which has spatial interaction by active flow of protoplasmic sol in the cell. Paying attention to the physiological evidence that the flow is determined by contraction pattern in the plasmodium, a reaction-diffusion system having self-determined flow arises. Such a coupling of reaction-diffusion-advection is a characteristic of the biological system, and is expected to relate with control mechanism of amoeboid behaviours. Hence, we have studied effects of the self-determined flow on pattern formation of simple reaction-diffusion systems. By weakly nonlinear analysis near a trivial solution, the envelope dynamics follows the complex Ginzburg-Landau type equation just after bifurcation occurs at finite wave number. The flow term affects the nonlinear term of the equation through the critical wave number squared. Contrary to this, wave number isn't explicitly effective with lack of flow or constant flow. Thus, spatial size of pattern is especially important for regulating pattern formation in the plasmodium. On the other hand, the flow term is negligible in the vicinity of bifurcation at infinitely small wave number, and therefore the pattern formation by simple reaction-diffusion will also hold. A physiological role of pattern formation as above is discussed.\",\n",

These `forces' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can be also applied to the description of other behaviors.   In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: First, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion. Second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance to other pedestrians and borders. Third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion are nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically.\",\n",

We argue that the stress continuity equations should be closed by means of scale-free, local constitutive relations between different components of the stress tensor, encoding the construction history of the pile: this history determines the organization of the grains, and thereby the local relationship between stresses. Our preferred model FPA (Fixed Principle Axes) assumes that the eigendirections (but not the eigenvalues) of the stress tensor are determined forever when a material element is first buried. Stresses propagate along a nested set of archlike structures within the medium; the results are in good quantitative agreement with published experimental data. The FPA model is one of a larger class, called OSL (Oriented Stress Linearity) models, in which the direction of the characteristics for stress propagation are fixed at burial. We speculate on the connection between these characteristics and the stress paths observed microscopically.',\n",
       " \"A stochastic model for behavioral changes by imitative pair interactions of individuals is developed. `Microscopic' assumptions on the specific form of the imitative processes lead to a stochastic version of the game dynamical equations. That means, the approximate mean value equations of these equations are the game dynamical equations of evolutionary game theory.   The stochastic version of the game dynamical equations allows the derivation of covariance equations. These should always be solved along with the ordinary game dynamical equations. On the one hand, the average behavior is affected by the covariances so that the game dynamical equations must be corrected for increasing covariances. Otherwise they may become invalid in the course of time. On the other hand, the covariances are a measure for the reliability of game dynamical descriptions. An increase of the covariances beyond a critical value indicates a phase transition, i.e. a sudden change in the properties of the considered social system.   The applicability and use of the introduced equations are illustrated by computational results for the social self-organization of behavioral conventions.\",\n",

By injecting an electrical current into a suspension of conducting nanoparticles we are able to initiate a process of self-organization which leads, in certain cases, to formation of a stable pattern which consists of continuous conducting chains of particles. The evolution of the dissipative state in such system is a complex process. It starts as an avalanche process characterized by nucleation, growth, and thermal destruction of such dissipative elements as continuous conducting chains of particles as well as electroconvective vortices. A power-law distribution of avalanche sizes and durations, observed at this stage of the evolution, indicates that the system is in a self-organized critical state. A sharp transition into an avalanche-free state with a stable pattern of conducting chains is observed when the power dissipated in the fluid reaches its maximum. We propose a simple evolution model which obeys the maximum power condition and also shows a power-law distribution of the avalanche sizes.',\n",

The hydration of imidazole and imidazolium solutes is used to exemplify the theoretical issues. The treatment of long-ranged electrostatic interactions in simulations is discussed extensively. It is argued that the Ewald approach is an easy way to get correct hydration free energies in the thermodynamic limit from molecular calculations; and that molecular simulations with Ewald interactions and periodic boundary conditions can also be more efficient than many common alternatives. The Ewald treatment permits a conclusive extrapolation to infinite system size. The picture that emerges from testing of simple models is that the most prominent failings of the simplest theories are associated with solvent proton conformations that lead to non-gaussian fluctuations of electrostatic potentials. Thus, the most favorable cases for the second-order perturbation theories are monoatomic positive ions. For polar and anionic solutes, continuum or gaussian theories are less accurate. The appreciation of the specific deficiencies of those simple models have led to new concepts, multistate gaussian and quasi-chemical theories, that address the cases for which the simpler theories fail. It is argued that, relative to direct dielectric continuum treatments, the quasi-chemical theories provide a better theoretical organization for the computational study of the electronic structure of solution species.',\n",

The basic object of the study is the correlation function of the nucleon interpolating field, where the matrix element is taken with respect to the one-nucleon state. The dispersion integral of the correlation function around the nucleon threshold is investigated in detail. It turns out that the integral can be identified as a measure of the nucleon-nucleon interaction strength, which is proportional to the scattering length in the small scattering length limit and to one half of the effective range in the large scattering length limit. New operators must be taken into account in the OPE of the correlation function. There behavior operators do not vanish when the matrix element is taken with respect to the spin-nonaveraged one-nucleon state. The Wilson coefficients of such operators are calculated. The sum rules obtained in this manner relate the spin-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction strengths with the spin-dependent nucleon matrix elements of the quark-gluon composite operators. The sum rules imply that the interaction is stronger in the spin-triplet channel than in the spin-singlet channel, but that the spin-dependence of the nucleon-nucleon interactions is rather small. In the spin-singlet channel the calculated strength is in qualitative agreement with the empirical strength, which is estimated by the empirical low energy scattering observables.',\n",

In comparison with previously explored conditions, namely symbolic coding of aminoacids and dipeptides frequencies, no significant improvement was observed in the classification of 69 cytochromes of the c type, characterized by a high degree of structural and functional similarity, while a substantial improvement occurred in the case of a data set including quite heterogeneous primary structures.\",\n",

The abelian group structure allows an exact calculation of many of its properties. In particular, one can calculate all the critical exponents for the directed model in all dimensions. For the undirected case, the model is related to q= 0 Potts model. This enables exact calculation of some exponents in two dimensions, and there are some conjectures about others. We also discuss a generalization of the model to a network of communicating reactive processors. This includes sandpile models with stochastic toppling rules as a special case. We also consider a non-abelian stochastic variant, which lies in a different universality class, related to directed percolation.',\n",

The outermost HII regions appear small, faint and isolated, compared to their inner disk counterparts, and are distributed in organized spiral arm structures, likely associated with underlying HI arms and faint stellar arms. The relationship between the azimuthally--averaged Halpha surface brightness (proportional to star formation rate per unit area) and the total gas surface density is observed to steepen considerably at low gas surface densities. We find that this effect is largely driven by a sharp decrease in the covering factor of star formation at large radii, and not by changes in the rate at which stars form locally. An azimuthally--averaged analysis of the gravitational stability of the disk of NGC6946 reveals that while the existence of star formation in the extreme outer disk is consistent with the Toomre-Q instability model, the low rates observed are only compatible with the model when a constant gaseous velocity dispersion is assumed. We suggest that observed behaviour could also be explained by a model in which the star formation rate has an intrinsic dependence on the azimuthally-averaged gas volume density, which decreases rapidly in the outer disk due to the vertical flaring of the gas layer.',\n",
       " \"A Parallel Self-Organizing Map (Parallel-SOM) is proposed to modify Kohonen's SOM in parallel computing environment. In this model, two separate layers of neurons are connected together. The number of neurons in both layers and connections between them is the product of the number of all elements of input signals and the number of possible classification of the data. With this structure the conventional repeated learning procedure is modified to learn just once. The once learning manner is more similar to human learning and memorizing activities. During training, weight updating is managed through a sequence of operations among some transformation and operation matrices. Every connection between neurons of input/output layers is considered as a independent processor. In this way, all elements of the Euclidean distance matrix and weight matrix are calculated simultaneously. The minimum distance of every line of distance matrix can be found by Grover's search algorithm. This synchronization feature improves the weight updating sequence significantly. With a typical classification example, the convergence result demonstrates efficient performance of Parallel-SOM. Theoretic analysis and proofs also show some important properties of proposed model. Especially, the paper proves that Parallel-SOM has the same convergence property as Kohonen's SOM, but the complexity of former is reduced obviously.\",\n",
       " \"We study the problem of how a ``living'' system complex in structure can respond perfectly to local changes in the environment. Such a system is assumed to consist of a distributed ``living'' medium and a hierarchical ``supplying'' network that provides this medium with ``nutritious'' products. Because of the hierarchical organization each element of the supplying network has to behave in a self-consistent way for the system can adapt to changes in the environment.   We propose a cooperative mechanism of self-regulation by which the system as a whole can react perfectly. This mechanism is based on an individual response of each element to the corresponding small piece of the information on the state of the ``living'' medium. The conservation of flux through the supplying network gives rise to a certain processing of information and the self-consistent behavior of the elements, leading to the perfect self-regulation. The corresponding equations governing the ``living'' medium state are obtained.\",\n",

Information storage, update and appropriate retrieval are controlled at the molecular level by the neuronal cytoskeleton which serves as the internal communication network within neurons. Information flow in the highly ordered parallel networks of the filamentous protein polymers which make up the cytoskeleton may be compared to atmospheric flows which exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations, i.e. long-term memory. Such long-range spatiotemporal correlations are ubiquitous to real world dynamical systems and is recently identified as signature of self-organized criticality or chaos. The signatures of self-organized criticality i.e. long-range temporal correlations have recently been identified in the electrical activity of the brain. A recently developed non-deterministic cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed long-range spatiotemporal correlations as intrinsic to quantum-like mechanics governing flow dynamics. The model visualises large scale circulations to form as the result of spatial integration of enclosed small scale perturbations with intrinsic two-way ordered energy flow between the scales. Such a concept maybe applied for the collection and integration of a multitude of signals at the cytoskeletal level and manifested in activation of neurons in the macroscale. The cytoskeleton networks inside neurons may be the elementary units of a unified dynamic memory circulation network with intrinsic global response to local stimuli.',\n",
       " \"We have coded a Boltzmann solver based on a finite difference scheme (S_N method) aiming at calculations of neutrino transport in type II supernovae. Close comparison between the Boltzmann solver and a Monte Carlo transport code has been made for realistic atmospheres of post bounce core models under the assumption of a static background. We have also investigated in detail the dependence of the results on the numbers of radial, angular, and energy grid points and the way to discretize the spatial advection term which is used in the Boltzmann solver. A general relativistic calculation has been done for one of the models. We find overall good agreement between the two methods. However, because of a relatively small number of angular grid points (which is inevitable due to limitations of the computation time) the Boltzmann solver tends to underestimate the flux factor and the Eddington factor outside the (mean) ``neutrinosphere'' where the angular distribution of the neutrinos becomes highly anisotropic. This fact suggests that one has to be cautious in applying the Boltzmann solver to a calculation of the neutrino heating in the hot-bubble region because it might tend to overestimate the local energy deposition rate. A comparison shows that this trend is opposite to the results obtained with a multi-group flux-limited diffusion approximation of neutrino transport. The accuracy of the Boltzmann solver can be considerably improved by using a variable angular mesh to increase the angular resolution in the semi-transparent regime.\",\n",

These patterns reflect the bacterial cooperative self-organization. Central part of the cooperation is the collective formation of lubricant on top of the agar which enables the bacteria to swim. Hence it provides the colony means to advance towards the food. One method of modeling the colonial development is via coupled reaction-diffusion equations which describe the time evolution of the bacterial density and the concentrations of the relevant chemical fields. This idea has been pursued by a number of groups. Here we present an additional model which specifically includes an evolution equation for the lubricant excreted by the bacteria. We show that when the diffusion of the fluid is governed by nonlinear diffusion coefficient branching patterns evolves. We study the effect of the rates of emission and decomposition of the lubricant fluid on the observed patterns. The results are compared with experimental observations. We also include fields of chemotactic agents and food chemotaxis and conclude that these features are needed in order to explain the observations.',\n",

We present LaSCO, the Language for Security Constraints on Objects, in which a policy consists of two parts: the domain (assumptions about the system) and the requirement (what is allowed assuming the domain is satisfied). Thus policies defined in LaSCO have the appearance of conditional access control statements. LaSCO policies are specified as expressions in logic and as directed graphs, giving a visual view of policy. LaSCO has a simple semantics in first order logic (which we provide), thus permitting policies we write, even for complex policies, to be very perspicuous. LaSCO has syntax to express many of the situations we have found to be useful on policies or, more interesting, the composition of policies. LaSCO has an object-oriented structure, permitting it to be useful to describe policies on the objects and methods of an application written in an object-oriented language, in addition to the traditional policies on operating system objects.

       " 'We examine the hypothesis proposed in recent years by several authors that the crust is in a self-organized critical (SOC) state by exploring how the SOC concept can help in understanding the observed earthquake clustering on relatively narrow fault domains and the phenomenon of induced seismicity. We review the major reported cases of induced seismicity in various parts of the world and find that both pore pressure changes (+/-p) and mass transfers (+/-m) leading to incremental deviatoric stresses of <<1 MPa are sufficient to trigger seismic instabilities in the uppermost crust with magnitude ranging up to 7.0 in otherwise historically aseismic areas. Once triggered, stress variations of at least 1 order of magnitude less but still larger than the ~0.01 MPa tidal stress are enough to sustain seismic activity. We argue that these observations are in accord with the SOC hypothesis as they show that a significant fraction of the crust is not far from instability and can thus be made unstable by minute perturbations. Not all perturbations, however, trigger seismic activity; this is also compatible with the SOC hypothesis which embodies naturally the existence of large heterogeneities in the stress field. In conclusion, the properties of induced seismicity and their rationalization in terms of the SOC concept provide further evidence that potential seismic hazards extend over a much larger area than that where earthquakes are frequent.',\n",

This model roughly corresponds to placing the irreversible Diffusion Limited Aggregation model (DLA) in contact with a heat bath. Particles release latent heat when aggregating, while singly connected cluster members can absorb heat and evaporate. The heat bath is initially empty, hence we observe the flow of entropy from the aggregating gas of particles into the heat bath, which is being populated by diffusing heat tokens. Before the population of the heat bath stabilizes, the cluster morphology (quantified by the fractal dimension) is similar to a standard DLA cluster. The cluster then gradually anneals, becoming more tenuous, until reaching configurational equilibrium when the cluster morphology resembles a quenched branched random polymer. As the microscopic dynamics is invertible, we can reverse the evolution, observe the inverse flow of heat and entropy, and recover the initial condition. This simple system provides an explicit example of how macroscopic dissipation and self-organization can result from an underlying microscopically reversible dynamics.',\n",

Dynamic scintillation spectra of pulsars were regularly monitored at 10-90 epochs spanning 100-1000 days. Significant changes are observed in the dynamic spectra over time scales as short as a few days. Large-amplitude fluctuations are observed in quantities such as decorrelation bandwidth, scintillation time scale, drift rate, and flux density. Several pulsars show organized features such as drifting bands in a highly pronounced manner. For some pulsars, gradual and systematic variations are seen in the drift rate of patterns which undergo several sign reversals during the observing time spans. Anomalous behaviour such as persistent drifts lasting over many months are seen for PSRs B0834+06 & B1919+21. Four pulsars were studied for 2-4 well separated observing sessions, each lasting over ~ 100 days. In some cases, significant variations are seen in the average scintillation properties and/or flux densities between successive observing sessions. From our data, we have been able to obtain more accurate and reliable estimates of scintillation properties and flux densities than those from the earlier observations, by averaging out the fluctuations due to refractive scintillation effects. These measurements are used to derive parameters such as the strength of scattering and scintillation speeds. The present measurements are compared with earlier measurements and the long-term stability of scintillation properties and flux densities is discussed.',\n",

These results are supported with numerical simulations in one dimension. The present model constitute a simple model which capture the essential difference between ordinary nonequilibrium critical phenomena, like DP, and self-organized criticality.',\n",
       " \"These lectures are designed to introduce the methods and results of large N_c QCD in a presentation intended for nuclear and particle physicists alike. Beginning with definitions and motivations of the approach, we demonstrate that all quark and gluon Feynman diagrams are organized into classes based on powers of 1/N_c. We then show that this result can be translated into definite statements about mesons and baryons containing arbitrary numbers of constituents. In the mesons, numerous well-known phenomenological properties follow as immediate consequences of simply counting powers of N_c, while for the baryons, quantitative large N_c analyses of masses and other properties are seen to agree with experiment, even when ``large'' N_c is set equal to its observed value of 3. Large N_c reasoning is also used to explain some simple features of nuclear interactions.\",\n",

We propose a mechanism for cooperative self-regulation that enables the system under consideration to respond properly to changes in the environment. This mechanism is based on (1) active individual behavior of the system elements at each hierarchical level and (2) self-processing of information caused by the hierarchical organization. It is shown how the proposed mechanism suppresses nonlocal interaction of elements belonging to a particular level as mediated by higher levels.',\n",

Organic dye guest molecules of 1-Ethyl-4-(4-(p-Dimethylaminophenyl)-1,3-butadienyl)-pyridinium Perchlorat were inserted into the 0.73-nm-wide channel pores of a zeolite AlPO$_4$-5 host. The zeolitic micro crystal compounds where hydrothermally synthesized according to a particular host-guest chemical process. The dye molecules are found not only to be aligned along the host channel axis, but to be oriented as well.

After aggregation, the amoebae collect into round \\'\\'pancake\" structures in which the cells rotate around the center of the pancake. This vortex state persists for many hours and we have explicitly verified that the motion is not due to rotating waves of cAMP. To provide an alternative mechanism for the self-organization of the Dictyostelium cells, we have developed a new model of the dynamics of self-propelled deformable objects. In this model, we show that cohesive energy between the cells, together with a coupling between the self-generated propulsive force and the cell\\'s configuration produces a self-organized vortex state. The angular velocity profiles of the experiment and of the model are qualitatively similar. The mechanism for self-organization reported here can possibly explain similar vortex states in other biological systems.',\n",
       " \"We propose a generalized version of the Dielectric Breakdown Model (DBM) for generic breakdown processes. It interpolates between the standard DBM and its analog with quenched disorder, as a temperature like parameter is varied. The physics of other well known fractal growth phenomena as Invasion Percolation and the Eden model are also recovered for some particular parameter values. The competition between different growing mechanisms leads to new non-trivial effects and allows us to better describe real growth phenomena.   Detailed numerical and theoretical analysis are performed to study the interplay between the elementary mechanisms. In particular, we observe a continuously changing fractal dimension as temperature is varied, and report an evidence of a novel phase transition at zero temperature in absence of an external driving field; the temperature acts as a relevant parameter for the ``self-organized'' invasion percolation fixed point. This permits us to obtain new insight into the connections between self-organization and standard phase transitions.\",\n",

Most fundamental stellar parameters of the individual components in SB2 eclipsing binaries are known with very high accuracy.

In the present work, we have used an empirically-calibrated grid of theoretical stellar spectra (BaSeL models) for simultaneously deriving homogeneous effective temperatures and metallicities from observed data. For this purpose, we have selected 20 binary systems (40 stars) for which we have uvby Stromgren photometry with estimated errors (see Lastennet et al., astro-ph/9811103, for details).',\n",

As a byproduct of this method, rigorous lower and higher bounds for the time to failure of very large systems are easily obtained. The asymptotic behavior of the resulting lower bound leads to the evidence that the above mentioned suspicion is actually true.',\n",

The problem is non-perturbative at momenta of the order of the inverse of the two-body scattering length. An infinite number of graphs must be summed, which leads to a cutoff dependence that does not appear in any order in perturbation theory. We argue that this cutoff dependence can be absorbed in one local three-body force counterterm and compute the running of the three-body force with the cutoff. This allows a calculation of the scattering of a particle and the two-particle bound state if the corresponding scattering length is used as input. We also obtain a model-independent relation between binding energy of a shallow three-body bound state and this scattering length. We comment on the power counting that organizes higher-order corrections and on relevance of this result for the effective field theory program in nuclear and molecular physics.',\n",
       " \"Segregation of populations is a key question in evolution theory. One important aspect is the relation between spatial organization and the population's composition. Here we study a specific example -- sectors in expanding bacterial colonies. Such sectors are spatially segregated sub-populations of mutants. The sectors can be seen both in disk-shaped colonies and in branching colonies. We study the sectors using two models we have used in the past to study bacterial colonies -- a continuous reaction-diffusion model with non-linear diffusion and a discrete ``Communicating Walkers'' model. We find that in expanding colonies, and especially in branching colonies, segregation processes are more likely than in a spatially static population. One such process is the establishment of stable sub- population having neutral mutation. Another example is the maintenance of wild-type population along side with sub-population of advantageous mutants. Understanding such processes in bacterial colonies is an important subject by itself, as well as a model system for similar processes in other spreading populations.\",\n",
       " 'We investigate the quantum conformal algebras of N=2 and N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. Phenomena occurring at strong coupling are analysed using the Nachtmann theorem and very general, model-independent, arguments. The results lead us to introduce a novel class of conformal field theories, identified by a closed quantum conformal algebra. We conjecture that they are the exact solution to the strongly coupled large-N_c limit of the open conformal field theories. We study the basic properties of closed conformal field theory and work out the operator product expansion of the conserved current multiplet T. The OPE structure is uniquely determined by two central charges, c and a. The multiplet T does not contain just the stress-tensor, but also R-currents and finite mass operators. For this reason, the ratio c/a is different from 1. On the other hand, an open algebra contains an infinite tower of non-conserved currents, organized in pairs and singlets with respect to renormalization mixing. T mixes with a second multiplet T* and the main consequence is that c and a have different subleading corrections. The closed algebra simplifies considerably at c=a, where it coincides with the N=4 one.',\n",

For this goal we used the appropriate optical constants of nanosized Si, essentially different from those of bulk Si due to quantum confinement. It was found that a dust mixture of silicon nanoparticles, bare graphite grains, silicate core-organic refractory mantle grains and three-layer silicate-water ice-organic refractory grains works well in explaining the extinction and, in addition, results in the acceptable fractions of UV/visible photons absorbed by silicon nanoparticles: 0.071-0.081. Since these fractions barely agree with the fraction of UV/visible photons needed to excite the observed ERE, we conclude that the intrinsic photon conversion efficiency of the photoluminescence by silicon nanoparticles must be near 100%, if they are the source of the ERE.',\n",
       " 'Sticky particle calculations indicate that a coherent structure, a dispersion ring, forms when a cloud on a low angular momentum orbit passes close to the dynamical center of an isothermal sphere containing a central point mass. The cloud is tidally stretched and differentially wrapped, and dissipation in shocks organizes the gas into a precessing off-set elliptical ring which can persist for many rotation periods. The morphology and kinematics of the circumnuclear disk (CND) between 2 and 5 pc and the Northern arm in the inner 1 pc are well-represented by such structures. In the case of the Northern Arm, strong shocks which arise during the formation of the dispersion ring can lead to star formation even in the near tidal field of a massive black hole.',\n",

In both cases the pairing correlations for superconducting order parameters with nodes are found to be enhanced. The symmetry and the enhancement of the pairing is systematically correlated with the spin structure factor, suggesting a spin-fluctuation mediated pairing.

       " 'The interlayer magnetoresistance of layered metals in a tilted magnetic field is calculated for two distinct models for the interlayer transport. The first model involves coherent interlayer transport and makes use of results of semi-classical or Bloch-Boltzmann transport theory. The second model involves weakly incoherent interlayer transport where the electron is scattered many times within a layer before tunneling into the next layer. The results are relevant to the interpretation of experiments on angular-dependent magnetoresistance oscillations (AMRO) in quasi-one- and quasi-two-dimensional metals. We find that the dependence of the magnetoresistance on the direction of the magnetic field is identical for both models except when the field is almost parallel to the layers. An important implication of this result is that a three-dimensional Fermi surface is not necessary for the observation of the Yamaji and Danner oscillations seen in quasi-two- and quasi-one-dimensional metals, respectively. A universal expression is given for the dependence of the resistance at AMRO maxima and minima on the magnetic field and scattering time (and thus the temperature). We point out three distinctive features of coherent interlayer transport: (i) a beat frequency in the magnetic oscillations of quasi-two-dimensional systems, (ii) a peak in the angular-dependent magnetoresistance when the field is sufficiently large and parallel to the layers, and (iii) a crossover from a linear to a quadratic field dependence for the magnetoresistance when the field is parallel to the layers. Properties (i) and (ii) are compared with published experimental data for a range of quasi-two-dimensional organic metals and for Sr2RuO4.',\n",

By this we explain the unusual low frequency optical activity of TTF-TCNQ, including the observed 10meV anomaly.

A Wannier-Mott transfer exciton is formed when the exciton in each semiconductor dot interacts via the multipole-multipole coupling with other excitons in the different dtos of the array. A new hybrid exciton appears in the system owing to strong dipole-dipole interaction of the Frenkel exciton of the organic molecules with the Wannier Mott transfer exciton of the quantum dot array. This hybrid exciton has both a large oscillator strength (Frenkel like) and a large Bohr radius (Wannier like). At resonance between these two types of excitons, the optical non-linearity is very large and can be controlled by changing parameters of the system such as dot radius and dot spacing.',\n",

       " 'Markets have internal dynamics leading to excess volatility and other phenomena that are difficult to explain using rational expectations models. This paper studies these using a nonequilibrium price formation rule, developed in the context of trading with market orders. Because this is so much simpler than a standard inter-temporal equilibrium model, it is possible to study multi-period markets analytically. There price dynamics have second order oscillatory terms.   Value investing does not necessarily cause prices to track values. Trend following causes short term trends in prices, but also causes longer-term oscillations. When value investing and trend following are combined, even though there is little linear structure, there can be boom-bust cycles,excess and temporally correlated volatility, and fat tails in price fluctuations. The long term evolution of markets can be studied in terms of flows of money.   Profits can be decomposed in terms of aggregate pairwise correlations.   Under reinvestment of profits this leads to a capital allocation model that is equivalent to a standard model in population biology. An investigation of market efficiency shows that patterns created by trend followers are more resistant to efficiency than those created by value investors, and that profit maximizing behavior slows the progression to efficiency. Order of magnitude estimates suggest that the timescale for efficiency is years to decades.',\n",

       " \"Experiments have widely shown that a steady-state lamellar eutectic solidification front is destabilized on a scale much larger than the lamellar spacing by the rejection of a dilute ternary impurity and forms two-phase cells commonly referred to as `eutectic colonies'. We extend the stability analysis of Datye and Langer for a binary eutectic to include the effect of a ternary impurity. We find that the expressions for the critical onset velocity and morphological instability wavelength are analogous to those for the classic Mullins-Sekerka instability of a monophase planar interface, albeit with an effective surface tension that depends on the geometry of the lamellar interface and, non-trivially, on interlamellar diffusion. A qualitatively new aspect of this instability is the occurence of oscillatory modes due to the interplay between the destabilizing effect of the ternary impurity and the dynamical feedback of the local change in lamellar spacing on the front motion. In a transient regime, these modes lead to the formation of large scale oscillatory microstructures for which there is recent experimental evidence in a transparent organic system. Moreover, it is shown that the eutectic front dynamics on a scale larger than the lamellar spacing can be formulated as an effective monophase interface free boundary problem with a modified Gibbs-Thomson condition that is coupled to a slow evolution equation for the lamellar spacing. This formulation provides additional physical insights into the nature of the instability and a simple means to calculate an approximate stability spectrum. Finally, we investigate the influence of the ternary impurity on a short wavelength oscillatory instability that is already present at off-eutectic compositions in binary eutectics.\",\n",

       " 'Researchers have proposed that the distinction between so-called \"simple\" and \"complex\" societies can be expressed by an increase in the number of levels at which functional organization, interaction, and thus selection, operate. In spite of the obvious links between this suggestion and research into complex social organization amongst insects and other social animals, the levels of selection model has seen little use among anthropologists. We suggest that the primary reason for lack of research into the evolutionary causes of social complexity has been the lack of descriptive units with which we can examine phenotypic variation and heritability of social organization above the level of the organism. The goal of our paper, therefore, is to begin constructing descriptive units which map to meaningful models of multi-level selection. In order to demonstrate how these units are useful in a real dataset, we examine the functional changes involved in the United States economy over the last 100 years, a period of time characterized, we believe, by significant changes in the number and kinds of social aggregates functioning as \"individuals\" with respect to selection. Our preliminary analysis suggests that it is possible to measure changes in the scale at which functional integration occurs through published data, and that the multilevel selection model for complex society may possess considerable power for describing how selection of culturally transmitted variation occurs in complex societies.',\n",

The resulting time-series representing left and right auditory cortex activity provide a clear evidence for two levels of neuronal cooperation. One is the local hemispheric collective response, termed M100 for its maximum at around 100ms after a stimulus onset. Its only global characteristics turn out to be time-locked to a stimulus, however, which means that the detailed neuronal evolution is largely stochastic. This, together with the $1/f$ character of the corresponding power spectrum indicates self-organized criticality as an underlying mechanism. The second level is communication between the two hemispheres with clear laterality effects: as a rule, the contralateral hemisphere leads by $\\\\sim$10ms.

Starting with the logistic equation and assuming that the carrying capacity of the environment is a function of the amount of resources, a mathematical model describing such pattern of population change is obtained. An application of this model to typical population records, that of deer herds by Scheffer (1951) and O'Roke and Hamerstrome (1948), yields estimations of the initial amount of indispensable food and its availability or nutritional efficiency which were previously unspecified.\",\n",

The method, called Extremal Optimization, successively eliminates extremely undesirable components of sub-optimal solutions. Drawing upon models used to simulate far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it complements approximation methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as Simulated Annealing. With only one adjustable parameter, its performance proves competitive with, and often superior to, more elaborate stochastic optimization procedures. We demonstrate it here on two classic hard optimization problems: graph partitioning and the traveling salesman problem.',\n",

The performance of this new method, called Extremal Optimization, is compared to Simulated Annealing in extensive numerical simulations. While generally a complex (NP-hard) problem, the optimization of the graph partitions is particularly difficult for sparse graphs with average connectivities near the percolation threshold. At this threshold, the relative error of Simulated Annealing for large graphs is found to diverge relative to Extremal Optimization at equalized runtime. On the other hand, Extremal Optimization, based on the extremal dynamics of self-organized critical systems, reproduces known results about optimal partitions at this critical point quite well.',\n",

In this formalism, various logarithmic corrections are organized to give the Wilson evolution from the W boson mass down to the characteristic scale of a decay process, which is of order of the b quark mass, and the Sudakov evolution from the characteristic scale to a lower factorization scale of order Lambda_{QCD}. With large logarithms organized, the b quark decay amplitudes are evaluated reliably in perturbation theory. Below the factorization scale, QCD dynamics is regarded as being nonperturbative, and absorbed into meson wave functions. Because of their universality, the heavy-meson wave functions determined in this work, can be employed to make predictions of other decay modes. We also observe that the dependence of heavy meson wave functions on intrinsic parton transverse momenta plays an important role in the explanation of data.',\n",

In addition, the particles locally interact by choosing at each time step the average direction of motion of their neighbors and the effects of fluctuations are taken into account as well. We present the first results for large scale flocking in the presence of noise in three dimensions.

Since these techniques require heavy computations, however, we developed a presentation server designed to serve as an intermediary between retrieval servers and clients equipped with a visualization interface. In addition, we designed our own visual interface by which users can view a set of documents from different perspectives through layers of document maps.

We show that sources and sinks are the important coherent structures that organize much of the dynamical properties of traveling wave systems. We present in detail the framework to analyze these coherent structures. Our counting arguments for the multiplicities of these structures show that independently of the coefficients of the CGL, there exists a symmetric stationary source solution, which sends out waves with a unique frequency and wave number. Sinks, on the other hand, occur in two-parameter families, and play an essentially passive role. Simulations show that sources can send out stable waves, convectively unstable waves, or absolutely unstable waves. We show that there exists an additional dynamical regime where both single- and bimodal states are unstable; the ensuing chaotic states have no counterpart in single amplitude equations. A third dynamical mechanism is associated with the fact that the width of the sources does not show simple scaling with the growth rate epsilon. In particular, when the group velocity term dominates over the linear growth term, no stationary source can exist, but sources displaying nontrivial dynamics can survive here. Our results are easily accessible by experiments, and we advocate a study of the sources and sinks as a means to probe traveling wave systems and compare theory and experiment.',\n",
       " 'Since all of the five clusters of galaxies observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer deep survey telescope are found to possess a diffuse EUV emitting component which is unrelated to the virial gas at X-ray temperatures, the question concerning the nature of this new component has been a subject of controversy. Here we present results of an EUV and soft X-ray spatial analysis of the rich clusters Abell 2199 and 1795. The EUV emission does not resemble the X-ray morphology of clusters: at the cluster core the EUV contours are organized, but at larger radii they are anisotropic, and therefore need not have originated from a hydrostatically stable medium. The ratio of EUV to soft X-ray intensity rises with respect to cluster radius, to reach values ~10 times higher than that expected from the virial gas. The strong EUV excess which exists in the absence of soft X-ray excess poses formidable problems to the non-thermal (inverse-Compton) scenario, but may readily be explained as due to emission lines present only in the EUV range. In particular, warm gas produced by shock heating could account for such lines without proliferation of bolometric luminosities and mass budgets.',\n",

The solutions include a coherent state, a phase-modified Gaussian wave packet in the potential of harmonic oscillator whose strength varies in time, a free Gaussian soliton, and a similar soliton in the potential of harmonic oscillator comoving with the soliton. The last of these solutions implies that there exist an energy level in the spectrum of harmonic oscillator which is not predicted by the linear theory. The free solitonic solution can be considered a model for a particle aspect of the wave-particle duality embodied in the quantum theory. The physical size of this particle is naturally rendered equal to its Compton wavelength in the subrelativistic framework in which the self-energy of the soliton is assumed to be equal to its rest-mass energy. The solitonic solutions exist only for the negative coupling constant for which the Gaussian wave packets must be larger than some critical finite size if their energy is to be bounded, i.e., they cannot be point-like objects.',\n",

By considering the device to be composed of an active subsystem with negative differential resistance and a passive resistive layer with positive differential resistance an analytical approach is suggested to understand and describe the corresponding physical mechanisms in a self-consistent way. Analytical solutions of the derived model equations allow a description of homogeneous stationary states and yield explicit expressions of the current-density vs. voltage characteristics of the whole structure and its subsystems. A stability analysis of the homogeneous states with respect to two-dimensional transversal harmonic fluctuations is performed for the two cases under study. The resulting dispersion relations allow two different types of instability. While the first one is of Ridley's type which is characteristic for any spatially extended electrical system with negative differential resistance, the second type can be considered as a solid-state analogue of Turing's instability known as a generic instability mechanism which may lead, e. g., to the formation of periodic patterns.\",\n",

For a class of systems possessing stochastic stability, we show that this new order parameter function is intimately related to the static order parameter function, describing the distribution of overlaps between clustering states. The same method is applied to investigate the geometrical organization of pure states. We show that the ultrametric organization in the dynamics implies static ultrametricity, and we relate these properties to static separability, i.e., the property that the measure of the overlap between pure states is essentially unique. Our results, especially relevant for spin glasses, pave the way to an experimental determination of the order parameter function.',\n",

Utilizing these capabilities, the colonies develop complex spatio-temporal patterns in response to adverse growth conditions. We present a wealth of branching and chiral patterns formed during colonial development of lubricating bacteria (bacteria which produce a wetting layer of fluid for their movement). Invoking ideas from pattern formation in non-living systems and using ``generic\\'\\' modeling we are able to reveal novel survival strategies which account for the salient features of the evolved patterns. Using the models, we demonstrate how communication leads to self-organization via cooperative behavior of the cells.

       " 'The aim of this paper is to present a generalization of Lunn-Senior\\'s mathematical model of isomerism in organic chemistry. The main idea of Lunn and Senior is that if the type of isomerism is fixed, a molecule with a fixed skeleton and d univalent substituents has a symmetry group $W\\\\leq S_d$ which is generally not the molecule\\'s 3-dimensional symmetry group. The unit character of W induces a representation of the symmetric group $S_d$ which governs the combinatorics of the isomers of the given molecule. Lunn-Senior\\'s thesis is that certain non-negative integers established by this representation are upper boundaries of the corresponding numbers, yielded by the experiment (and often coincide with them). Moreover, the authors define (in a particular case) a partial order among the objects of the model, such that some simple substitution reactions correspond to inequalities. These two groups of data determine the group W, and produce so called \"type properties\" of the molecule (properties which do not depend on the nature of the univalent substituents). Our hypothesis is that if we replace the unit character of $W$ by any one-dimensional character of $W$ (thus we count only a part of the isomers - those having a maximum property), we also get a type property of the molecule. An instance of that is the inventory of the stereoisomers called chiral pairs. The formalism can be generalized naturally and produces some preliminary chemical results. Especially the partial order is defined and studied in the general case and indicates the possible genetic relations among the corresponding molecules. An important result of E. Ruch which connects the dominance order among partitions and the existence of chiral pairs is obtained as a consequence of a more general statement.',\n",

       " 'A relativistic light front formulation of nuclear dynamics is developed and applied to treating infinite nuclear matter in a method which includes the correlations of pairs of nucleons: this is light front Brueckner theory. We start with a hadronic meson-baryon Lagrangian that is consistent with chiral symmetry. This is used to obtain a light front version of a one-boson-exchange nucleon-nucleon potential (OBEP). The accuracy of our description of the nucleon-nucleon (NN) data is good, and similar to that of other relativistic OBEP models. We derive, within the light front formalism, the Hartree-Fock and Brueckner Hartree-Fock equations. Applying our light front OBEP, the nuclear matter saturation properties are reasonably well reproduced. We obtain a value of the compressibility, 180 MeV, that is smaller than that of alternative relativistic approaches to nuclear matter in which the compressibility usually comes out too large. Because the derivation starts from a meson-baryon Lagrangian, we are able to show that replacing the meson degrees of freedom by a NN interaction is a consistent approximation, and the formalism allows one to calculate corrections to this approximation in a well-organized manner. The simplicity of the vacuum in our light front approach is an important feature in allowing the derivations to proceed. The mesonic Fock space components of the nuclear wave function are obtained also, and aspects of the meson and nucleon plus-momentum distribution functions are computed.

We find that there is a threshold in synaptic strength, $\\\\tau_c$, below which there are no stable spiking network states. Above threshold the stable spiking state is a cluster state, where different groups of neurons fire consecutively, and each neuron fires with the same cluster each time. Weak noise destabilizes this state, but stronger noise drives the system into a different, self-organized, stochastically synchronized state. Neuronal firing is still organized in clusters, but individual neurons can hop from cluster to cluster. Noise can actually induce and sustain such a state below the threshold of synaptic strength. We do find a qualitative difference in the firing patterns between small ($\\\\sim 10$ neurons) and large ($\\\\sim 1000$ neurons) networks. We determine the information content of the spike trains in terms of two separate contributions: the spike time jitter around cluster firing times, and the hopping from cluster to cluster. We quantify the information loss due to temporally correlated interspike intervals.

The main prediction of this model is that the statistically preferred state for such equations consists of a deterministic coherent structure coupled with fine-scale, random fluctuations, or radiation. The model is derived from equilibrium statistical mechanics by using a mean-field approximation of the conserved Hamiltonian and particle number for finite-dimensional spectral truncations of the NLS dynamics. The continuum limits of these approximated statistical equilibrium ensembles on finite-dimensional phase spaces are analyzed, holding the energy and particle number at fixed, finite values. The analysis shows that the coherent structure minimizes total energy for a given value of particle number and hence is a solution to the NLS ground state equation, and that the remaining energy resides in Gaussian fluctuations equipartitioned over wavenumbers. Some results of direct numerical integration of the NLS equation are included to validate empirically these properties of the most probable states for the statistical model. Moreover, a theoretical justification of the mean-field approximation is given, in which the approximate ensembles are shown to concentrate on the associated microcanonical ensemble in the continuum limit.',\n",

       " 'A glorious achievement of twentieth century Physics is the identification of the building blocks of nature. A related triumph a deep understanding of the forces of interaction. In particular, it has been possible to understand the four fundamental forces of nature in an elegant and unified mathematical framework. The paradigm for this unification has been the principle of gauge symmetry.   A new approach to achieving further unification relies on Supersymmetry. This is a symmetry which relates particles of integer spin with those of half-integral spin and also dictates the allowed interactions among these particles. However, no data exist pointing to the presence of this symmetry; it may indeed be of no relevance to nature.   In this paper the gauge principle and unification attempts are briefly reviewed, and then Supersymmetry is introduced. The notion of \"broken\" symmetry is discussed, which may explain why the symmetry is difficult to observe at presently accessible energies. But a badly broken manifestation seems to remove much of the original appeal and elegance of the theory. We here propose two alternative views of the status of Supersymmetry from fundamental standpoint. There is a good reason why it is indeed a fundamental symmetry, despite badly broken. The alternative is that it is an organizing principle, somewhat like valence. This makes it valuable as a signpost to new Physics.',\n",
       " \"The effects of wind-driven star formation feedback on the spatio-temporal organization of stars and gas in galaxies is studied using two-dimensional intermediate-representational quasi-hydrodynamical simulations. The model retains only a reduced subset of the physics, including mass and momentum conservation, fully nonlinear fluid advection, inelastic macroscopic interactions, threshold star formation, and momentum forcing by winds from young star clusters on the surrounding gas. Expanding shells of swept-up gas evolve through the action of fluid advection to form a ``turbulent'' network of interacting shell fragments whose overall appearance is a web of filaments (in two dimensions). A new star cluster is formed whenever the column density through a filament exceeds a critical threshold based on the gravitational instability criterion for an expanding shell, which then generates a new expanding shell after some time delay. A filament- finding algorithm is developed to locate the potential sites of new star formation. The major result is the dominance of multiple interactions between advectively-distorted shells in controlling the gas and star morphology, gas velocity distribution and mass spectrum of high mass density peaks, and the global star formation history. The gas morphology observations of gas in the LMC and in local molecular clouds. The frequency distribution of present-to-past average global star formation rate, the distribution of gas velocities in filaments (found to be exponential), and the cloud mass spectra (estimated using a structure tree method), are discussed in detail.\",\n",

We consider one dimensional and triangular lattices, for which we give a microscopic description of the dynamics, prove the propagation of a particle through the scatterers, and compute analytically its statistical properties.

In both cases, the origin of the propagation is a blocking mechanism, restricting the motion of the particle in the direction opposite to the ultimate propagation direction, and there is a specific re-organization of the spins after the passage of the particle. A detailed mathematical analysis of this phenomenon is, to the best of our knowledge, presented here for the first time.',\n",

The fluctuations account for the difference between the conserved value of the Hamiltonian and the Hamiltonian of the coherent state. The predictions of the statistical theory are tested against the results of direct numerical simulations of NLS, and excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement is demonstrated. In addition, a careful inspection of the numerical simulations reveals interesting features of the transitory dynamics leading up to the to the long-time statistical equilibrium state starting from a given initial condition.

Moreover, R_H is positive for hole-doped compounds and is negative for electron-doped ones, although each of them has a similar hole-like Fermi surface. In this paper, we give the explanation of this long-standing problem from the standpoint of the nearly antiferromagnetic (AF) Fermi liquid. We consider seriously the vertex corrections for the current which are indispensable to satisfy the conservation laws, which are violated within the conventional Boltzmann transport approximation. The obtained total current J_k takes an enhanced value and is no more perpendicular to the Fermi surface due to the strong AF fluctuations. By virtue of this mechanism, the anomalous behavior of R_H in high-Tc cuprates is neutrally explained. We find that both the temperature and the (electron, or hole) doping dependences of R_H in high-T_c cuprates are reproduced well by numerical calculations based on the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, applied to the single-band Hubbard model.

They demonstrate the important role played by amplitude fluctuations of the backscattering potential and by fluctuations in gradients of the potential, and confirm the importance of the self-consistency which is a key feature of the 'FLEX'-type approximations for the electron Green's function. Our results allow an assessment of the merits of different approximations: a previous approximate treatment presented by Sadovskii and, we show, justified by a WKB approximation gives a reasonably good representation, except for a ``central peak'' anomaly, of our numerically computed densities of states, whereas a previous approximation introduced by Lee, Rice and Anderson is not as accurate.\",\n",
       " 'We propose a new data structure to compute the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points in the plane. It combines good worst case complexity, fast behavior on real data, and small memory occupation.   The location structure is organized into several levels. The lowest level just consists of the triangulation, then each level contains the triangulation of a small sample of the levels below. Point location is done by marching in a triangulation to determine the nearest neighbor of the query at that level, then the march restarts from that neighbor at the level below. Using a small sample (3%) allows a small memory occupation; the march and the use of the nearest neighbor to change levels quickly locate the query.',\n",
       " 'We have analysed in detail the discovery measurements of the X-ray burster SAX J1750.8-2900 by the Wide Field Cameras on board BeppoSAX in spring 1997, at a position ~1.2 degrees off the Galactic Centre. The source was in outburst on March 13th when the first observation started and showed X-ray emission for ~ 2 weeks. A total of 9 bursts were detected, with peak intensities varying from ~ 0.4 to 1.0 Crab in the 2-10 keV range. Most bursts showed a fast rise time (~ 1s), an exponential decay profile with e-folding time of ~ 5s, spectral softening during decay, and a spectrum which is consistent with few keV blackbody radiation. These features identify them as type-I X-ray bursts of thermonuclear origin. The presence of type-I bursts and the source position close to the Galactic Centre favours the classification of this object as a neutron star low mass X-ray binary. X-ray emission from SAX J1750.8-2900 was not detected in the previous and subsequent Galactic bulge monitoring, and the source was never seen bursting again.',\n",
       " 'A variational approach to finite connectivity spin-glass-like models is developed and applied to describe the structure of optimal solutions in random satisfiability problems. Our variational scheme accurately reproduces the known replica symmetric results and also allows for the inclusion of replica symmetry breaking effects. For the 3-SAT problem, we find two transitions as the ratio $\\\\alpha$ of logical clauses per Boolean variables increases. At the first one $\\\\alpha_s \\\\simeq 3.96$, a non-trivial organization of the solution space in geometrically separated clusters emerges. The multiplicity of these clusters as well as the typical distances between different solutions are calculated. At the second threshold $\\\\alpha_c \\\\simeq 4.48$, satisfying assignments disappear and a finite fraction $B_0 \\\\simeq 0.13$ of variables are overconstrained and take the same values in all optimal (though unsatisfying) assignments. These values have to be compared to $\\\\alpha_c \\\\simeq 4.27, B_0 \\\\simeq 0.4$ obtained from numerical experiments on small instances. Within the present variational approach, the SAT-UNSAT transition naturally appears as a mixture of a first and a second order transition. For the mixed $2+p$-SAT with $p<2/5$, the behavior is as expected much simpler: a unique smooth transition from SAT to UNSAT takes place at $\\\\alpha_c=1/(1-p)$.',\n",

It is shown that the system is organized close to a boundary of marginal stability in such a way that fluctuations follow power law distributions both in species abundance and their lifetimes for some slow-driving (immigration) regime. The connectivity and the number of species are linked through a scaling relation which is the one observed in real ecosystems. These results suggest that the basic macroscopic features of real, species-rich ecologies might be linked with a critical state. A natural link between lognormal and power law distributions of species abundances is suggested.',\n",

       " 'The explosive crystallization of germanium ultradisperse amorphous films is studied experimentally. We show that crystallization may be initiated by local heating at the small film thickness but it realizes spontaneously at the large ones. The fractal pattern of the crystallized phase is discovered that is inherent in the phenomena of diffusion limited aggregation. It is shown that in contrast to the ordinary crystallization mode the explosive one is connected with the instability which is caused by the self-heating. A transition from the first mechanism to the second one is modelled by Lorenz system. The process of explosive crystallization is represented on the basis of the self-organized criticality conception. The front movement is described as the effective diffusion in the ultrametric space of hierarchically subordinated avalanches, corresponding to the explosive crystallization of elementary volumes of ultradisperse powder. The expressions for the stationary crystallization heat distribution and the steady-state heat current are obtained. The heat needed for initiation of the explosive crystallization is obtained as a function of the thermometric conductivity. The time dependence of the spontaneous crystallization probability in a thin films is examined.',\n",

Appropriate transition temperatures and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry of the gap function are obtained in good agreement with experimental results. We also calculate the transition temperature by the fluctuation-exchange approximation(FLEX) in order to compare the two approaches; FLEX gives higher transition temperatures rather than the perturbation approach. However, it is also found that the vertex corrections, which are ignored in FLEX, have a crucial effect on $T_{\\\\rm c}$ for strongly frustrated systems. The density of states and the normal self-energy calculated in this perturbation scheme show the nature of the conventional Fermi liquid near the Mott-insulator. Thus, our perturbation approach is applicable to the conventional metallic phase of this compound, while it cannot explain the (pseudo-)spin gap phenomenon which signals the non-Fermi liquid.',\n",

       " \"E-business, information serving, and ubiquitous computing will create heavy request traffic from strangers or even incognitos. Such requests must be managed automatically. Two ways of doing this are well known: giving every incognito consumer the same treatment, and rendering service in return for money. However, different behavior will be often wanted, e.g., for a university library with different access policies for undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, alumni, citizens of the same state, and everyone else.   For a data or process server contacted by client machines on behalf of users not previously known, we show how to provide reliable automatic access administration conforming to service agreements. Implementations scale well from very small collections of consumers and producers to immense client/server networks. Servers can deliver information, effect state changes, and control external equipment.   Consumer privacy is easily addressed by the same protocol. We support consumer privacy, but allow servers to deny their resources to incognitos. A protocol variant even protects against statistical attacks by consortia of service organizations.   One e-commerce application would put the consumer's tokens on a smart card whose readers are in vending kiosks. In e-business we can simplify supply chain administration.

       " 'Current-day genomes bear the mark of the evolutionary processes. One of the strongest indications is the sequence homology among families of proteins that perform similar biological functions in different species. The number of proteins in a family can grow over time as genetic information is duplicated through evolution. We explore how evolution directs the size distribution of these families. Theoretical predictions for family sizes are obtained from two models, one in which individual genes duplicate and a second in which the entire genome duplicates. Predictions from these models are compared with the family size distributions for several organisms whose complete genome sequence is known. We find that protein family size distributions in nature follow a power-law distribution. Comparing these results to the model systems, we conclude that genome duplication is the dominant mechanism leading to increased genetic material in the species considered.',\n",

The spectrometer is intended for direct measurements of ultra low fluxes of fast neutrons. It is sensitive to neutron fluxes of 10^-7 neutrons/(cm^2 s^1) and lower with the neutron energy above 700 keV. The detection efficiency of fast neutrons with simultaneous energy measurement is within 0.02-0.06. The neutron spectrometer was designed taking into account requirements for minimizing the gamma-ray background. It is a calorimeter based on a pure liquid organic scintillator-thermalizer with helium proportional counters as capturers of thermalized neutrons distributed uniformly over the volume. Low-level signal electronics for the spectrometer were designed with signal-to-noise ratio optimization and full pulse shape analysis required for efficient rejection of background events.

The finite-size scaling of this distribution function with the lattice size is usually enough to assume that any cut off will disappear as the lattice size goes to infinity. This approach, however, can lead to misleading conclusions. In this work we analyze the behavior of the branching rate sigma of the events to establish whether a system is in a critical state. We apply this method to the Olami-Feder-Christensen model to obtain evidences that, in contrast to previous results, the model is critical in the conservative regime only.',\n",

Initially, Berk and Schrieffer showed how paramagnon spin fluctuations could suppress superconductivity in nearly-ferromagnetic materials. Following this, Rietschel and various co-workers wrote a number of papers in which they investigated the role of spin fluctuations in reducing the T_c of various electron-phonon superconductors. Paramagnon spin fluctuations are also believed to provide the p-wave pairing mechanism responsible for the superfluid phases of $^3He$. More recently, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations have been proposed as the mechanism for d-wave pairing in the heavy-fermion superconductors and in some organic materials as well as possibly the high T_c cuprates. Here I will review some of this early history and discuss some of the things we have learned more recently from numerical simulations.',\n",

Dynamical mean-field theory, which maps the Hubbard model onto a single impurity Anderson model that is solved self-consistently, and becomes exact in the limit of large dimensionality, is used. As the temperature increases there is a smooth crossover from coherent Fermi liquid excitations at low temperatures to incoherent excitations at high temperatures. This crossover leads to a non-monotonic temperature dependence for the resistance, thermopower, and Hall coefficient, unlike in conventional metals. The resistance smoothly increases from a quadratic temperature dependence at low temperatures to large values which can exceed the Mott-Ioffe-Regel value, hbar a/e^2 (where \"a\" is a lattice constant) associated with mean-free paths less than a lattice constant. Further signatures of the thermal destruction of quasiparticle excitations are a peak in the thermopower and the absence of a Drude peak in the optical conductivity.

Investigations of systems with such principle of a structure formation reveal that the system's dynamics has typical features of self-organized criticality phenomenon. In the avalanche-like processes, which occur in the wiring dynamics, a power law was found with the index close to 1.4.

The production of a LeBlanc-Wilson MHD jet could provide an asymmetric supernova and result in a weak gamma-ray burst when the jet accelerates down the stellar density gradient of a hydrogen-poor photosphere. The matter-dominated jet would be formed promptly, but requires 5 to 10 s to reach the surface of the progenitor of a Type Ib/c supernova. During this time, the newly-born neutron star could contract, spin up, and wind up field lines or turn on an alpha-Omega dynamo. In addition, the light cylinder will contract from a radius large compared to the Alfven radius to a size comparable to that of the neutron star. This will disrupt the structure of any organized dipole field and promote the generation of ultrarelativistic MHD waves (UMHDW) at high density and Large Amplitude Electromagnetic Waves (LAEMW) at low density. The generation of the these waves would be delayed by the cooling time of the neutron star about 5 to 10 seconds, but the propagation time is short so the UMHDW could arrive at the surface at about the same time as the matter jet. In the density gradient of the star and the matter jet, the intense flux of UMHDW and LAEMW could drive shocks, generate pions by proton-proton collision, or create electron/positron pairs depending on the circumstances. The UMHDW and LAEMW could influence the dynamics of the explosion and might also tend to flow out the rotation axis to produce a collimated gamma-ray burst.',\n",

       " \"The beautiful sequences of ``drifting'' subpulses observed in some radio pulsars have been regarded as among the most salient and potentially instructive characteristics of their emission, not least because they have appeared to represent a system of subbeams in motion within the emission zone of the star. Numerous studies of these ``drift'' sequences have been published, and a model of their generation and motion articulated long ago by Ruderman & Sutherland (1975); but efforts thus far have failed to establish an illuminating connection between the drift phemomenon and the actual sites of radio emission. Through a detailed analysis of a nearly coherent sequence of ``drifting'' pulses from pulsar B0943+10, we have in fact identified a system of subbeams circulating around the magnetic axis of the star. A mapping technique, involving a ``cartographic'' transform and its inverse, permits us to study the character of the polar-cap emission ``map'' and then to confirm that it, in turn, represents the observed pulse sequence. On this basis, we have been able to trace the physical origin of the ``drifting-subpulse'' emission to a stably rotating and remarkably organized configuration of emission columns, in turn traceable possibly to the magnetic polar-cap ``gap'' region envisioned by some theories.\",\n",

We find that the fluence or energy distribution of bursts is consistent with a power law of index 1.66, over 4 orders of magnitude. This scale-free distribution resembles the Gutenberg-Richter Law for earthquakes, and gives evidence for self-organized criticality in SGRs. The distribution of time intervals between successive bursts from SGR 1900+14 is consistent with a log-normal distribution. There is no correlation between burst intensity and the waiting times till the next burst, but there is some evidence for a correlation between burst intensity and the time elapsed since the previous burst. We also find a correlation between the duration and the energy of the bursts, but with significant scatter. In all these statistical properties, SGR bursts resemble earthquakes and solar flares more closely than they resemble any known accretion-powered or nuclear-powered phenomena. Thus our analysis lends support to the hypothesis that the energy source for SGR bursts is internal to the neutron star, and plausibly magnetic.',\n",
       " \"Within the framework of the quantized nesting model, we study the effect of umklapp scattering on the magnetic-field-induced spin-density-wave (SDW) phases which are experimentally observed in the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors (TMTSF)$_2$X. We discuss the conditions under which umklapp processes may explain the sign reversals (Ribault anomaly) of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) observed in these conductors. We find that the `Ribault phase' is characterized by the coexistence of two SDWs with comparable amplitudes. This gives rise to additional long wavelength collective modes besides the Goldstone modes due to spontaneous translation and rotation symmetry breaking. These modes strongly affect the optical conductivity. We also show that the Ribault phase may become helicoidal (i.e with circularly polarized SDWs) if the strength of umklapp processes is sufficiently strong. The QHE vanishes in the helicoidal phases, but a magnetoelectric effect appears.\",\n",
       " \"We study the long-wavelength collective modes in the magnetic-field-induced spin-density-wave (FISDW) phases experimentally observed in organic conductors of the Bechgaard salts family, focusing on phases that exhibit a sign reversal of the quantum Hall effect (Ribault anomaly). We have recently proposed that two SDW's coexist in the Ribault phase, as a result of Umklapp processes. When the latter are strong enough, the two SDW's become circularly polarized (helicoidal SDW's). In this paper, we study the collective modes which result from the presence of two SDW's. We find two Goldstone modes, an out-of-phase sliding mode and an in-phase spin-wave mode, and two gapped modes. The sliding Goldstone mode carries only a fraction of the total optical spectral weight, which is determined by the ratio of the amplitude of the two SDW's. In the helicoidal phase, all the spectral weight is pushed up above the SDW gap. We also point out similarities with phase modes in two-band or bilayer superconductors. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic two-SDW systems.\",\n",
       " 'We discuss a phenomenological approach to the description of unstable vehicle motion on multilane highways that could explain in a simple way such observed self-organizing phenomena as the sequence of the phase transitions \"free flow -> synchronized motion -> jam\" and the hysteresis in them.   We introduce a new variable called order parameter that accounts for possible correlations in the vehicle motion at different lanes. So, it is principally due to \"many-body\" effects in the car interaction in contrast to such variables as the mean car density and velocity being actually the zeroth and first moments of the \"one-particle\" distribution function. Therefore, we regard the order parameter as an additional independent state variable of traffic flow and formulate the corresponding evolution equation governing the lane changing rate.   In this context we analyze the instability of homogeneous traffic flow manifesting itself in both of the mentioned above phase transitions where and endowing them with the hysteresis. Besides, the jam state is characterized by the vehicle flows at different lanes being independent of one another.',\n",
       " \"Two-dimensional (2D) strongly correlated electron systems underlie many of the most important phenomena in contemporary condensed matter physics, including the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE), ``high T_c'' superconductivity, and possible exotic conducting states in silicon MOSFETs. We demonstrate the existence of yet another exotic ground state in strongly correlated, 2D electronic materials: a novel, insulating bond-order/charge density wave state (BCDW) in the commensurate 1/4-filled band that persists for all anisotropies within the 2D lattice, in contradiction to the non-interacting electron prediction of the vanishing of density waves in 2D for non-1/2-filled bands. The persistence of the BCDW in the 2D lattice is a consequence of strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction and the resultant ``confinement,'' a concept recently widely debated. Our results have implications for experiments in the organic charge transfer solids (CTS), where they explain the observation of a ``mysterious'' coexistence of density waves, clarify the optical conductivity of the ``metallic'', and suggest an approach to the observed organic superconductivity.\",\n",

The observation that there is a strong negative correlation between stock prices and the spread variable relies on the examination of 8 major crashes in the United States between 1857 and 1987. That relationship which has remained valid for one and a half century in spite of important changes in the organization of financial markets can be of interest in the perspective of Monte Carlo simulations of stock markets.\",\n",

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.',\n",

There are several paths from a conventional critical point to SOC. They begin with an absorbing-state phase transition (directed percolation is a familiar example), and impose supervision or driving on the system; two commonly used methods are extremal dynamics, and driving at a rate approaching zero. We illustrate this in sandpiles, where SOC is a consequence of slow driving in a system exhibiting an absorbing-state phase transition with a conserved density. Other paths to SOC, in driven interfaces, the Bak-Sneppen model, and self-organized directed percolation, are also examined. We review the status of experimental realizations of SOC in light of these observations.',\n",

Non-classical pitchfork singularities also occur in many non-symmetric systems, where the total bifurcation environment is usually more complex. In this paper three-dimensional manifolds of critical points, or limit-point shells, are introduced by examining several bifurcation problems that contain a pitchfork as an organizing centre. Comparison of these surfaces shows that notionally equivalent problems can have significant positional differences in their bifurcation behaviour. As a consequence, the parameter range of jump, hysteresis, or phase transition phenomena in dynamical models (and the physical systems they purport to represent) is determined by other singularities that shape the limit-point shell.',\n",

In order to characterize the origin of this anomaly, we have studied its behavior under the application of hydrostatic pressure. The observed behavior is found to mimic those of the transport and magnetic properties of these materials which have been attributed to the magnetic fluctuations. Following the example of one-dimensional insulating systems where coupling between longitudinal acoustic waves and magnetic fluctuations is known to occur, our results suggest that the pseudo-gap regime of these two-dimensional organic superconductors is dominated by a similar mechanism.',\n",

When the Fermi level lies in the flat part, the electron correlation should cause ferromagnetic spin fluctuations to develop with an enhanced susceptibility. A relatively small magnetic field will then shift the majority-spin Fermi level to the dispersive part, resulting in a negative magnetoresistance. We have actually confirmed the idea by calculating the conductivity in magnetic fields, with the fluctuation exchange approximation, for the repulsive Hubbard model on a square lattice having a large second nearest-neighbor hopping.',\n",

We show that to reproduce the observed X-ray to optical flux ratio in A0620-00, we need to assume X-ray irradiation of the outer disk that is significantly in excess of what is expected for a standard planar disk. With enhanced irradiation, the Esin et al. model can reproduce the optical evolution of A0620-00 in outburst very well. Though we find that optical observations of GRS 1124-68 also imply enhanced X-ray heating of the outer disk, the irradiation appears to be a factor of roughly 3 weaker in this system than in A0620-00. This is surprising, since GRS 1124-68 has a larger disk. We speculate that enhanced irradiation may be due to disk warping, and that the degree of warping differs between the two binaries.',\n",

These issues are more precisely analyzed in terms of the essential mechanisms of momentum transfer to a hadron while remaining intact. Different factorization schemes are considered and the conceptual lacunas are pointed out. The quite technical subject of renormalization-group evolution is given a detailed account.

Beyond a projected distance of ~20 pc, however, the jets are found to have |RM| < 100 rad/m/m. Such sharp RM gradients cannot be produced by cluster or galactic-scale magnetic fields, but rather must be the result of magnetic fields organized over the central 1-100 pc. The RMs of the sources studied to date and the polarization properties of BL Lacs, quasars and galaxies are shown to be consistent so far with the predictions of unified schemes. The direct detection of high RMs in these quasar cores can explain the low fractional core polarizations usually observed in quasars at centimeter wavelengths as the result of irregularities in the Faraday screen on scales smaller than the telescope beam. Variability in the RM of the core is reported for 3C 279 between observations taken 1.5 years apart, indicating that the Faraday screen changes on that timescale, or that the projected superluminal motion of the inner jet components samples a new location in the screen with time. Either way, these changes in the Faraday screen may explain the dramatic variability in core polarization properties displayed by quasars.',\n",

As an attempt to generate the demand process, we distinguish between dictatorship associations, where groups of agents rely on one of them to make decision, and democratic associations, where each agent takes part in the group decision. In the dictatorship model, agents segregate into two distinct populations, while the democratic model is driven towards a critical state where groups of agents of all sizes exist. Hence, both models display a level of organization, but only the democratic model is self-organized.

Several exact results are obtained, including the upper critical density above which there are only jamming configurations asymptotically, and the lower critical density below which there are only moving configurations asymptotically. The jamming transition observed in the ensemble average velocity takes place at another critical density $p_{c}(N)$, which is dependent on the lattice size $N$ and is in the intermediate region between the lower and upper critical densities. It is suggested that $p_{c}(N)$ is proportional to a power of $N$, in good agreement with the numerical simulation. The order parameter of this jamming transition is identified.',\n",
       " \"We show that one-dimensional quantum systems with gapless degrees of freedom and open boundary conditions form a new universality class of quantum critical behavior, which we propose to call ``bounded Luttinger liquids''. They share the following properties with ordinary (periodic) Luttinger liquids: absence of fermionic quasi-particle excitations, charge-spin separation, anomalous power-law correlations with exponents whose scaling relations are parametrized by a single coupling constant per degree of freedom, $K_{\\\\nu}$. The values of $K_{\\\\nu}$ are independent of boundary conditions, but the representation of the critical exponents in terms of these $K_{\\\\nu}$ depends on boundary conditions. We illustrate these scaling relations by exploring general rules for boundary critical exponents derived earlier using the Bethe Ansatz solution of the 1D Hubbard model together with boundary conformal field theory, and the theory of Luttinger liquids in finite-size systems. We apply this theory to the photoemission properties of the organic conductors $(TMTSF)_2X$, and discuss to what extent the assumption of finite strands with open boundaries at the sample surface can reconcile the experimental results with independent information on the Luttinger liquid state in these materials.\",\n",

A multishift coupler generates a random function f() so that for each real x, f(x)-x is governed by the same fixed probability distribution, such as a normal distribution. We develop the class of layered multishift couplers, which are simple and have several useful properties. For the standard normal distribution, for instance, the layered multishift coupler generates an f() which (surprisingly) maps an interval of length L to fewer than 2+L/2.35 points --- useful in applications which perform computations on each such image point. The layered multishift coupler improves and simplifies algorithms for generating perfectly random samples from several distributions, including the autogamma distribution, posterior distributions for Bayesian inference, and the steady state distribution for certain storage systems. We also use the layered multishift coupler to develop a Markov-chain based perfect sampling algorithm for the autonormal distribution.   At the request of the organizers, we begin by giving a primer on CFTP (coupling from the past); CFTP and Fill's algorithm are the two predominant techniques for generating perfectly random samples using coupled Markov chains.\",\n",
       " 'Combining results for the local cosmic rate and mean peak luminosity of GRBs with the cosmic history of the star formation rate, we provide estimates for the local GRB rate per unit blue luminosity in galaxies. We find a typical GRB rate per unit B luminosity of 2.4x10^-17 h_{70}^2/Lsun/yr. The corresponding mean rate in the Milky Way is 5.5x10^-7 h_{70}^2/yr. We conclude: 1) the ratio of supernova rate to isotropic equivalent GRB rate is large: more than 6000 SNIbc per GRB or 30,000 SNII per GRB. GRBs could arise in a large fraction of black hole-forming events only with collimation in the range 0.01 - 0.001 and a steep enough slope of the IMF; 2) GRBs cannot account for the majority of large HI holes observed in galaxies; 3) the probability that the solar system was exposed to a fluence large enough to melt the chondrules during the first 10^7 yr of solar system history is negligibly small; 4) Even for very opaque atmospheres, a significant fraction of the GRB energy is transmitted as UV lines due to excitation by secondary electrons. For eukaryotic-like organisms in thin atmospheres (e.g. contemporary Mars), or for UV line exposure in thick atmospheres (e.g. Earth), biologically significant events occur at a rate of about 100--500 /Gyr. The direct contribution of these \"jolts\" to mutational evolution may, however, be negligible because of the short duration of the GRBs. Evolutionary effects due to partial sterilizations and to longer-lived disruptions of atmospheric chemistry should be more important. (Abridged)',\n",

Instead, we describe here a simple discrete branching process which generates the observed distributions and find that the distribution's deviation from power-law form is not caused by disequilibration, but rather that it is time-independent and determined by the evolutionary properties of the taxa of interest. Our model predicts-with no free parameters-the rank-frequency distribution of number of families in fossil marine animal orders obtained from the fossil record.

       " 'Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and incoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed.

At the same time it becomes rougher and rougher uncovering the critical spatial correlations typical of percolation. From this, the chemical process reveals the latent percolation criticality hidden in any random system. Recently, a simple minimal model has been introduced by Sapoval et al. to describe this phenomenon. Through analytic and numerical study, we obtain a detailed description of the process. The time evolution of the solution corroding power and of the distribution of resistance of surface sites is studied in detail. This study explains the progressive hardening of the solid surface.

Results from ergonomics \\\\cite{BEST91} indicate that rotating workforce schedules have a profound impact on the health and social life of employees as well as on their performance at work. Moreover, rotating workforce schedules must satisfy legal requirements and should also meet the objectives of the employing organization. We describe our solution to this problem. A basic design decision was to aim at quickly obtaining high-quality schedules for realistically sized problems while maintaining human control. The interaction between the decision maker and the algorithm therefore consists in four steps: (1) choosing a set of lengths of work blocks (a work block is a sequence of consecutive days of work shifts), (2) choosing a particular sequence of work and days-off blocks among those that have optimal weekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the chosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences of shifts, and (4) assignment of shift sequences to work blocks while fulfilling the staffing requirements. The combination of constraint satisfaction and problem-oriented intelligent backtracking algorithms in each of the four steps allows to find good solutions for real-world problems in acceptable time. Computational results from real-world problems and from benchmark examples found in the literature confirm the viability of our approach. The algorithms are now part of a commercial shift scheduling software package.',\n",

Second, we find that the BCDW further coexists with a spin-density wave (SDW) in the range of large anisotropy. Further, in contrast to the interacting half-filled band, in the interacting quarter-filled band there are two transitions: first, a similar singlet-to-AFM/SDW transition for large anisotropy and second, an AFM/SDW-to-singlet transition at smaller anisotropy. We discuss how these theoretical results apply to the insulating states that are proximate to the superconducting states of 2:1 cationic charge-transfer solids (CTS).

Our more complex technique organizes the cells in blocks that perform a reliable simulation of a second (generalized) cellular automaton. The cells of the latter automaton are also organized in blocks, simulating even more reliably a third automaton, etc. Since all this (a possibly infinite hierarchy) is organized in ``software'', it must be under repair all the time from damage caused by errors. A large part of the problem is essentially self-stabilization recovering from a mess of arbitrary size and content. The present paper constructs an asynchronous one-dimensional fault-tolerant cellular automaton, with the further feature of ``self-organization''. The latter means that unless a large amount of input information must be given, the initial configuration can be chosen homogeneous.\",\n",
       " 'We consider the emission of gravitational waves in the two proposed models for the collapse of a massive star to a black hole: the prompt collapse, in which nearly all the star collapses to a black hole in a dynamical time scale, and the delayed collapse, in which a light black hole, or a neutron star, which subsequently accretes matter, forms due to the fall-back achieving, in the neutron star case, the critical mass for black hole formation. Recent simulations strongly support this last scenario. We show that, due to the slowness of fall-back, in the delayed collapse the main burst of gravitational radiation is emitted depending on the parameters, mass and angular momentum, of the initial, light, black hole. We estimate, under different assumptions, the detectability of the emitted gravitational waves showing that such kind of collapse is not particularly suited for detection by forthcoming interferometric detectors. Detectors with high sensitivity at frequencies greater than ~4-5 kHz would be well suited for this kind of sources. We calculate also the final mass distribution function of single black holes.',\n",
       " 'The papers gathered in this collection were presented at the 8th International Workshop on Nonmonotonic Reasoning, NMR2000. The series was started by John McCarthy in 1978. The first international NMR workshop was held at Mohonk Mountain House, New Paltz, New York in June, 1984, and was organized by Ray Reiter and Bonnie Webber.   In the last 10 years the area of nonmonotonic reasoning has seen a number of important developments. Significant theoretical advances were made in the understanding of general abstract principles underlying nonmonotonicity. Key results on the expressibility and computational complexity of nonmonotonic logics were established. The role of nonmonotonic reasoning in belief revision, abduction, reasoning about action, planing and uncertainty was further clarified. Several successful NMR systems were built and used in applications such as planning, scheduling, logic programming and constraint satisfaction.   The papers in the proceedings reflect these recent advances in the field. They are grouped into sections corresponding to special sessions as they were held at the workshop:   1. General NMR track   2. Abductive reasonig   3. Belief revision: theory and practice   4. Representing action and planning   5. Systems descriptions and demonstrations   6.

       " 'We explain the emergence and robustness of intense jets in highly turbulent planetary atmospheres, like on Jupiter, by a general approach of statistical mechanics of potential vorticity patches. The idea is that potential vorticity mixing leads to the formation of a steady organized coarse grained flow, corresponding to the statistical equilibrium state. Our starting point is the quasi-geostrophic 1-1/2 layer model, and we consider the relevant limit of a small Rossby radius of deformation. Then narrow jets are obtained, scaling like the Rossby radius of deformation. These jets can be either zonal, or closed into a ring bounding a vortex. Taking into account the effect of the beta effect and a sublayer deep shear flow, we predict an organization of the turbulent atmospheric layer into an oval-shaped vortex amidst a background shear. Such an isolated vortex is centered over an extremum of the equivalent topography (determined by the deep shear flow and beta-effect). This prediction is in agreement with analysis of wind data in major Jovian vortices (Great Red Spot and Oval BC).',\n",

       " 'A system-level genetic code is a hypothetical genetic code that exclusively or preferentially codes systems of interacting coadapted parts. System-level genetic codes differ from part-level genetic codes in which each discrete part is coded independently. In general, a system-level genetic code requires coding discrete interacting parts such as organs or proteins in an interdependent way. Changing a single symbol or \"gene\" in a system-level genetic code affects two or more parts in a coordinated way. System-level genetic codes provide a plausible mechanism for evolution by leaps also known as systemic macromutations or hopeful monsters without invoking an intelligent agent, vitalistic forces, or new laws of physics. A system-level genetic code may explain the rapid appearance of new forms of life in the fossil record such as the Cambrian Explosion in which most invertebrate phyla appeared. A system-level genetic code may explain the origin of complex integrative systems of tightly coadapted proteins such as the blood coagulation cascade in which the removal or structural modification of any single part breaks the system. It is demonstrated that a simple system-level genetic code can, in principle, be implemented using biochemical mechanisms similar or identical to the mechanisms used by transposable elements, regulation of gene expression, and the adaptive vertebrate immune system. It is further suggested that cancer in the body and both normal and tumor cell lines cultured in vitro are caused by mutations of the system-level genetic code. An explanation why multi-cellular organisms retain the ability to revert to uni-cellularity and thus a tendency to develop cancer is presented.',\n",
       " 'Quasi-low-dimensional type II superconductors in parallel magnetic fields are studied when singlet pairing interactions and relatively weak triplet pairing interactions coexist. Singlet and triplet components of order parameter are mixed at high fields, and at the same time an inhomogeneous superconducting state called a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state occurs. As a result, the triplet pairing interactions enhance the upper critical field of superconductivity remarkably even at temperatures far above the transition temperature of parallel spin pairing. It is found that the enhancement is very large even when the triplet pairing interactions are so weak that a high field phase of parallel spin pairing may not be observed in practice. A possible relvance of the result in organic superconductors and a hybrid-ruthenate-cuprate superconductor is discussed.',\n",
       " \"The fracture of materials is a catastrophic phenomenon of considerable technological and scientific importance. Here, we analysed experiments designed for industrial applications in order to test the concept that, in heterogeneous materials such as fiber composites, rocks, concrete under compression and materials with large distributed residual stresses, rupture is a genuine critical point, i.e. the culmination of a self-organization of damage and cracking characterized by power law signatures. Specifically, we analyse the acoustic emissions recorded during the pressurisation of spherical tanks of kevlar or carbon fibers pre-impregnated in a resin matrix wrapped up around a thin metallic liner (steel or titanium) fabricated and instrumented by A\\\\'erospatiale-Matra Inc. These experiments are performed as part of a routine industrial procedure which tests the quality of the tanks prior to shipment and varies in nature. We find that the seven acoustic emission recordings of seven pressure tanks which was brought to rupture exhibit clear acceleration in agreement with a power law ``divergence'' expected from the critical point theory. In addition, we find strong evidence of log-periodic corrections that quantify the intermittent succession of accelerating bursts and quiescent phases of the acoustic emissions on the approach to rupture. An improved model accounting for the cross-over from the non-critical to the critical region close to the rupture point exhibits interesting predictive potential.\",\n",
       " 'We discuss a two-dimensional model for the dynamics of axonemal deformations driven by internally generated forces of molecular motors. Our model consists of an elastic filament pair connected by active elements. We derive the dynamic equations for this system in presence of internal forces. In the limit of small deformations, a perturbative approach allows us to calculate filament shapes and the tension profile. We demonstrate that periodic filament motion can be generated via a self-organization of elastic filaments and molecular motors. Oscillatory motion and the propagation of bending waves can occur for an initially non-moving state via an instability termed Hopf bifurcation. Close to this instability, the behavior of the system is shown to be independent of microscopic details of the axoneme and the force-generating mechanism. The oscillation frequency however does depend on properties of the molecular motors. We calculate the oscillation frequency at the bifurcation point and show that a large frequency range is accessible by varying the axonemal length between 1 and 50$\\\\mu$m. We calculate the velocity of swimming of a flagellum and discuss the effects of boundary conditions and externally applied forces on the axonemal oscillations.',\n",

       " 'We present sub-arcsecond resolution ground-based near-infrared images of the central regions of a sample of twelve barred galaxies with circumnuclear star formation activity, which is organized in ring-like regions typically one kiloparsec in diameter. We also present Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared images of ten of our sample galaxies, and compare them with our ground-based data. Although our sample galaxies were selected for the presence of circumnuclear star formation activity, our broad-band near-infrared images are heterogeneous, showing a substantial amount of small-scale structure in some galaxies, and practically none in others. We argue that, where it exists, this structure is caused by young stars, which also cause the characteristic bumps or changes in slope in the radial profiles of ellipticity, major axis position angle, surface brightness and colour at the radius of the circumnuclear ring in most of our sample galaxies. In 7 out of 10 HST images, star formation in the nuclear ring is clearly visible as a large number of small emitting regions, organised into spiral arm fragments, which are accompanied by dust lanes. NIR colour index maps show much more clearly the location of dust lanes and, in certain cases, regions of star formation than single broad-band images. Circumnuclear spiral structure thus outlined appears to be common in barred spiral galaxies with circumnuclear star formation.',\n",

       " 'Sexual reproduction presents significant challenges to formal treatment of evolutionary processes. A starting point for systematic treatments of ecological and evolutionary phenomena has been provided by the gene centered view of evolution which assigns effective fitness to each allele instead of each organism. The gene centered view can be formalized as a dynamic mean field approximation applied to genes in reproduction / selection dynamics. We show that the gene centered view breaks down for symmetry breaking and pattern formation within a population; and show that spatial distributions of organisms with local mating neighborhoods in the presence of disruptive selection give rise to such symmetry breaking and pattern formation in the genetic composition of local populations. Global dynamics follows conventional coarsening of systems with nonconserved order parameters. The results have significant implications for the ecology of genetic diversity and species formation.',\n",

We study the asymptotic behaviour of the spin space-time correlation function in the direction of the magnetic field and the singularities of its Fourier transform.   The work is organized in two parts. In the present paper an expansion for the ground state energy and the effective potential is derived, which is convergent if the running coupling constants are small enough. In the subsequent paper, by using hidden symmetries of the model, we show that this condition is indeed verified, if J_3 is small enough, and we derive an expansion for the spin correlation function. We also prove, by means of an approximate Ward identity, that a critical index, related with the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation function, is exactly vanishing.',\n",

       " \"A Cantorian fractal spacetime, a family member of von Neumann's noncommutative geometry is introduced as a geometry underlying a new relativity theory which is similar to the relation between general relativity and Riemannian geometry.

The calculated average dimension is very close to the value of $4+\\\\phi^3 $ (where $\\\\phi$ is the golden mean) obtained by El Naschie on the basis of a different approach. It is shown that within the framework of the new relativity the cosmological constant problem is nonexistent, since the Universe self-organizes and self-tunes according to the renormalization group (RG) flow with respect to a local scaling microscopic arrow of time. This implies that the world emerged as a result of a non-equilibrium process of self-organized critical phenomena launched by vacuum fluctuations in Cantorian fractal spacetime $\\\\cal E^{\\\\infty}$.

       " 'This paper is written as a brief introduction for beginning graduate students. The picture of electron waves moving in a cristalline potential and interacting weakly with each other and with cristalline vibrations suffices to explain the properties of technologically important materials such as semiconductors and also simple metals that become superconductors. In magnetic materials, the relevant picture is that of electrons that are completely localized, spin being left as the only relevant degree of freedom. A number of recently discovered materials with unusual properties do not fit in any of these two limiting cases. These challenging materials are generally very anisotropic, either quasi one-dimensional or quasi two-dimensional, and in addition their electrons interact strongly but not enough to be completely localized. High temperature superconductors and certain organic conductors fall in the latter category. This paper discusses how the effect of low dimension leads to new paradigms in the one-dimensional case (Luttinger liquids, spin-charge separation), and indicates some of the attempts that are being undertaken to develop, concurrently, new methodology and new concepts for the quasi-two-dimensional case, especially relevant to high-temperature superconductors.',\n",

This leads to establishement size distributions, which we compare to reality.

       " 'A number of cortical structures are reported to have elevated single unit firing rates sustained throughout the memory period of a working memory task. How the nervous system forms and maintains these memories is unknown but reverberating neuronal network activity is thought to be important. We studied the temporal structure of single unit (SU) activity and simultaneously recorded local field potential (LFP) activity from area LIP in the inferior parietal lobe of two awake macaques during a memory-saccade task. Using multitaper techniques for spectral analysis, which play an important role in obtaining the present results, we find elevations in spectral power in a 50--90 Hz (gamma) frequency band during the memory period in both SU and LFP activity. The activity is tuned to the direction of the saccade providing evidence for temporal structure that codes for movement plans during working memory. We also find SU and LFP activity are coherent during the memory period in the 50--90 Hz gamma band and no consistent relation is present during simple fixation. Finally, we find organized LFP activity in a 15--25 Hz frequency band that may be related to movement execution and preparatory aspects of the task. Neuronal activity could be used to control a neural prosthesis but SU activity can be hard to isolate with cortical implants. As the LFP is easier to acquire than SU activity, our finding of rich temporal structure in LFP activity related to movement planning and execution may accelerate the development of this medical application.',\n",
       " 'Universality in the behavior of complex systems often reveals itself in the form of scale-invariant distributions that are essentially independent of the details of the microscopic dynamics. A representative paradigm of complex behavior in nature is cooperative evolution.

A striking example of such cooperative phenomena is the formation of urban aggregates which, in turn, can be considered to cooperate in giving rise to nations. We find that population and area distributions of nations follow an inverse power-law behavior, as is known for cities. The exponents, however, are radically different in the two cases ($\\\\mu \\\\approx 1$ for nations, $\\\\mu \\\\approx 2$ for cities).

Exact numerical calculations reveal the unexpected result that localization is relatively independent of the precise location or organization of the scatterers. Localization occurs within a finite region of frequencies, coincident with the complete band gap predicted by a conventional band structure calculation for a periodic lattice of scatterers. Inside the gap or localization regime, a previously uninvestigated stable collective behavior of the cylinders appears.',\n",

       " 'We have obtained echelle spectra with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the MgII 2800A region of ten stars whose metallicities range from 1/300 to 1/3 that of the Sun, and whose space velocities suggest a halo or old thick-disk origin. Spectra of all ten show double-peaked emission in the MgII core, very much like the quiet Sun. A half-dozen non-rotating stars were observed more than once, and show at most a low level of variability in the emission flux, comparable to that of quiet stars of solar metallicity. For four stars, we have obtained Lyman-alpha spectra at 0.2A resolution; all four show emission. The data thus strongly suggest that chromospheric activity at a minimum level is present in all stars of near-solar temperature, regardless of age or metallicity. While this points to non-magnetic sources such as acoustic waves, a contribution from globally-organized magnetic fields is possible at a low level. We plan a longer series of MgII and Lyman alpha observations to constrain this.',\n",
       " \"Evolution produces complex and structured networks of interacting components in chemical, biological, and social systems. We describe a simple mathematical model for the evolution of an idealized chemical system to study how a network of cooperative molecular species arises and evolves to become more complex and structured. The network is modeled by a directed weighted graph whose positive and negative links represent `catalytic' and `inhibitory' interactions among the molecular species, and which evolves as the least populated species (typically those that go extinct) are replaced by new ones. A small autocatalytic set (ACS), appearing by chance, provides the seed for the spontaneous growth of connectivity and cooperation in the graph. A highly structured chemical organization arises inevitably as the ACS enlarges and percolates through the network in a short, analytically determined time scale. This self-organization does not require the presence of self-replicating species. The network also exhibits catastrophes over long time scales triggered by the chance elimination of `keystone' species, followed by recoveries.\",\n",

When driven by extremal dynamics, the model self-organizes {\\\\em not} to an attractor state, but to an asymptote, on which the economy has a constant rate of deflation, is critical, and exhibits avalanches of activity with power-law distributed sizes. This example demonstrates that self-organized critical behavior occurs in a larger class of systems than so far considered: systems not driven to an attractive fixed point, but, e.g., an asymptote, may also display self-organized criticality.',\n",

By coarse-graining we arrive at a continuous Langevin equation for the propagation of avalanches and calculate all the critical exponents characterizing them.

       " 'In this paper we investigate three-dimensional superconformal gauge theories with N=3 supersymmetry. Independently from specific models, we derive the shortening conditions for unitary representations of the Osp(3|4) superalgebra and we express them in terms of differential constraints on three dimensional N=3 superfields. We find a ring structure underlying these short representations, which is just the direct generalization of the chiral ring structure of N=2 theories. When the superconformal field theory is realized on the world-volume of an M2-brane such superfield ring is the counterpart of the ring defined by the algebraic geometry of the 8-dimensional cone transverse to the brane. This and other arguments identify the N=3 superconformal field theory dual to M-theory compactified on AdS_4 x N^{0,1,0}. It is an N=3 gauge theory with SU(N) x SU(N) gauge group coupled to a suitable set of hypermultiplets, with an additional Chern Simons interaction. The AdS/CFT correspondence can be directly verified using the recently worked out Kaluza Klein spectrum of N^{0,1,0} and we find a perfect match. We also note that besides the usual set of BPS conformal operators dual to the lightest KK states, we find that the composite operators corresponding to certain massive KK modes are organized into a massive spin 3/2 N=3 multiplet that might be identified with the super-Higgs multiplet of a spontaneously broken N=4 theory.

In this opening paper of the proceedings book, I describe them and document their strong impact on the academic life of the local institutions. The advanced research course was open to graduate students, senior researchers, and motivated under-graduate students with good background in physics and mathematics. The course covered several multi-disciplinary issues of modern research on astrophysical dynamics, and thus also of interest to physicists, mathematicians and engineers. The major topic was gas dynamics, viewed in context with stellar dynamics and plasma physics. The course was complemented by parallel seminars on hot topics given by experts in such fields, and open to a wide scientific audience. In particular, I gave a friendly introduction to wavelets, which are becoming an increasingly powerful tool not only for processing signals and images but also for analysing fractals and turbulence, and which promise to have important applications to dynamical modelling of disc galaxies. The workshop was open to a wide scientific audience. The workshop with published proceedings book was, as a matter of fact, the innovative form of exam that I proposed for the advanced research course. The contributions were refereed and their quality is high on average, exceptionally high in a few cases. The advanced research course and the workshop all together produced great enthusiasm in the students and welcomed the participation of a hundred different people, which means an order of magnitude more than an average graduate course at Chalmers University of Technology and G\\\\\"oteborg University.',\n",

The initial cloud is spherical while the magnetic field is uniform and transverse to the cloud motion. A simplified analytical model that describes the magnetic energy evolution in front of the cloud is developed and compared with simulation results. In addition, it is found the interaction of the cloud with a magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) results in the formation of a highly structured magnetotail. The magnetic flux in the wake of the cloud organizes into flux ropes and a reconnection, current sheet is developed, as field lines of opposite polarity are brought close together near the symmetry axis. At the same time, magnetic pressure is strongly enhanced at the leading edge of the cloud from the stretching of the field lines that occurs there. This has an important dynamical effect on the subsequent evolution of the cloud, since some unstable modes tend to be strongly enhanced.',\n",
       " 'A clustering analysis is performed on two samples of $\\\\sim 600$ faint galaxies each, in two widely separated regions of the sky, including the Hubble Deep Field. One of the survey regions is configured so that some galaxy pairs span angular separations of up to 1 deg. The median redshift is $z_{med}\\\\approx 0.55$. Strong clustering is obvious, with every pencil-beam field containing a handful of narrow redshift-space features, corresponding to galaxy structures with sizes of 5 to 20 Mpc. The structures are not obviously organized on planes, though one prominent, colinear triplet of structures is observed, spanning $\\\\sim 20$ Mpc. This may be evidence of a filament. A galaxy--galaxy correlation function calculation is performed. No significant evolution of clustering (relative to stable clustering) is found in the redshift range 0.3<z<1.0. This is not surprising, since uncertainties in the correlation amplitude estimated from surveys like these are large; field-to-field variations and covariances between data points are both shown to be significant. Consistent with other studies in this redshift range, the galaxy--galaxy correlation length is found to be somewhat smaller than that predicted from local measurements and an assumption of no evolution. Galaxies with absorption-line-dominated spectra show much stronger clustering at distances of <2 Mpc than typical field galaxies. There is some evidence for weaker clustering at intermediate redshift than at low redshift, when the results presented here are compared with surveys of the local Universe. In subsets of the data, the measured pairwise velocity dispersion of galaxies ranges from 200 to $600 km s^{-1}$, depending on the properties of the dominant redshift structures in each subset.',\n",

The simulations show even for very simple elementary reactions the spontaneous emergence of localized complex structures. In turn the effective dynamics of these structures affects the average behavior of the system in a very decisive way: systems which would according to the differential equations approximation die, display in reality a very lively behavior.

       " \"We investigate through high resolution 3D simulations the nonlinear evolution of compressible magnetohydrodynamic flows subject to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We confirm in 3D flows the conclusion from our 2D work that even apparently weak magnetic fields embedded in Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable plasma flows can be fundamentally important to nonlinear evolution of the instability. In fact, that statement is strengthened in 3D by this work, because it shows how field line bundles can be stretched and twisted in 3D as the quasi-2D Cat's Eye vortex forms out of the hydrodynamical motions. In our simulations twisting of the field may increase the maximum field strength by more than a factor of two over the 2D effect. If, by these developments, the Alfv\\\\'en Mach number of flows around the Cat's Eye drops to unity or less, our simulations suggest magnetic stresses will eventually destroy the Cat's Eye and cause the plasma flow to self-organize into a relatively smooth and apparently stable flow that retains memory of the original shear. For our flow configurations the regime in 3D for such reorganization is $4\\\\lesssim M_{Ax} \\\\lesssim 50$, expressed in terms of the Alfv\\\\'en Mach number of the original velocity transition and the initial Alfv\\\\'en speed projected to the flow plan. For weaker fields the instability remains essentially hydrodynamic in early stages, and the Cat's Eye is destroyed by the hydrodynamic secondary instabilities of a 3D nature. Then, the flows evolve into chaotic structures that approach decaying isotropic turbulence. In this stage, there is considerable enhancement to the magnetic energy due to stretching, twisting, and turbulent amplification, which is retained long afterwards. The magnetic energy eventually catches up to the kinetic energy, and the nature of flows become magnetohydrodynamic.\",\n",

The solution of this simple model is recalled, and possible variations discussed. It is shown numerically that despite its simplicity, it can mimic a size effect comparable to a crash. Two extensions of this model are presented that allow to simulate the demand process. One of these extensions has a coherent stable equilibrium and is self-organized, while the other has a bistable equilibrium, with a spontaneous segregation of the population of agents. A new model is introduced to generate a transition between those two equilibriums. We show that the coherent state is dominant up to an equal mixing of the two extensions.

Using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis we demonstrate that scale-dependent measures prove substantially superior to scale-independent ones. The wavelet-transform standard deviation at a scale near 32 heartbeat intervals, and its spectral counterpart near 1/32 cycles/interval, turn out to provide reliable results using heartbeat records just minutes long.

The community of the nine possible toxicity/resistance types undergoes a critical phase transition as the uniform transmutation rates between the types decreases below a critical value $P_c$ above which all the nine types of strain coexist with equal frequencies. Passing the critical mutation rate from above, the system collapses into one of the three topologically identical states, each consisting of three strain types.

       " 'We use a coarse-grained model of superconducting vortices driven through a random pinning potential to study the nonlinear current-voltage (IV) characteristics of flux flow in type II superconductors with pinning. In experiments, the IV relation measures flux flow down a flux density gradient. The work presented here treats this key feature explicitly. As the vortex repulsion weakens, the vortex pile maintains a globally steeper slope, corresponding to a larger critical current, for the same pinning potential. In addition, the magnitude of the peak in the differential resistance falls as the resistance peak shifts to higher currents. The model also exhibits so-called \"IV fingerprints\", and crossover to Ohmic (linear) behavior at high currents. Thus, many of the varieties of plastic behavior observed experimentally for soft flux line systems in the ``peak regime\\'\\' are reproduced in numerical simulations of the zero temperature model.

       " 'We address the problem of decomposing graphs in perturbative QCD into terms associated with particular regions. Motivated by asking how to incorporate next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections in parton-shower algorithms, we require that: (a) The integrand for the hard part is to be integrable even if the corrections are applied to a process that is not infrared and collinear safe. (b) The splitting between the terms should be defined gauge-invariantly. (c) The dependence on cut-offs should obey homogeneous evolution equations. In the context of one-gluon-emission graphs for deep inelastic scattering, we explain a subtractive technique that is based on gauge-invariant Wilson-line operators. Appropriate organization of subtractions involving the soft region allows a connection to previous work where evolution equations with respect to the directions of the Wilson lines have been derived.',\n",
       " 'The possibility that some of the observed X-ray and optical variability in active galactic nuclei and galactic black hole candidates is produced in accretion disks through the development of a self-organized critical state is reconsidered. New simulations, including more complete calculations of relativistic effects, do show that this model can produce light-curves and power-spectra for the variability which agree with the range observed in optical and X-ray studies of AGN and X-ray binaries. However, the universality of complete self-organized criticality is not quite achieved. This is mainly because the character of the variations depend quite substantially on the extent of the unstable disk region. If it extends close to the innermost stable orbit then a physical scale is introduced and the scale-free character of self-organized criticality is vitiated. Significant dependence of the power spectrum density slope on the type of diffusion within the disk and a weaker dependence on the amount of differential rotation are noted. When general relativistic effects are incorporated in the models, additional substantial differences are produced if the disk is viewed from directions far from the accretion disk axis.',\n",

The analytical calculations can be done when many LLs are occupied. We consider the cases of fixed particle number ($N=const$), fixed chemical potential ($\\\\mu =const$) and the intermediate situation of finite electron reservoir. The last case takes place in organic metals due to quasi-one-dimensional sheets of Fermi surface.   We obtained the envelopes of magnetization oscillations in all these cases in the limit of low temperature and Dingle temperature, where the oscillations can not be approximated by few first terms in the harmonic expansion. The results are compared and shown to be substantially different for different shapes of LLs.   The simple relation between the shape of LLs and the wave form of magnetization oscillations is found. It allows to obtain the density of states distribution at arbitrary magnetic field and spin-splitting using the measurement of the magnetization curve.   The analytical formula for the magnetization at $\\\\mu =const$ and the Lorentzian shape of LLs at arbitrary temperature, Dingle temperature and spin splitting is obtained and used to examine the possibility of the diamagnetic phase transition in 2D metals.',\n",
       " 'For many probability distributions of interest, it is quite difficult to obtain samples efficiently. Often, Markov chains are employed to obtain approximately random samples from these distributions. The primary drawback to traditional Markov chain methods is that the mixing time of the chain is usually unknown, which makes it impossible to determine how close the output samples are to having the target distribution. Here we present a new protocol, the randomness recycler (RR), that overcomes this difficulty. Unlike classical Markov chain approaches, an RR-based algorithm creates samples drawn exactly from the desired distribution. Other perfect sampling methods such as coupling from the past use existing Markov chains, but RR does not use the traditional Markov chain at all. While by no means universally useful, RR does apply to a wide variety of problems. In restricted instances of certain problems, it gives the first expected linear time algorithms for generating samples. Here we apply RR to self-organizing lists, the Ising model, random independent sets, random colorings, and the random cluster model.',\n",
       " \"Evolution of genetic code is studied as the change in the choice of enzymes that are used to synthesize amino acids from the genetic information of nucleic acids. We propose the following theory: the differentiation of physiological states of a cell allows for the different choice of enzymes, and this choice is later fixed genetically through evolution. To demonstrate this theory, a dynamical systems model consisting of the concentrations of metabolites, enzymes, amino acyl tRNA synthetase, and tRNA-amino acid complex in a cell is introduced and numerically studied. It is shown that the biochemical states of cells are differentiated by cell-cell interaction, and each differentiated type takes to use different synthetase. Through the mutation of genes, this difference in the genetic code is amplified and stabilized. Relevance of this theory to the evolution of non-universal genetic code in mitochondria is suggested.   The present theory for the evolution of genetic code is based on our recent theory of isologous symbiotic speciation, which is briefly reviewed. According to the theory, phenotypes of organisms are first differentiated into distinct types through the interaction and developmental dynamics, even though they have identical genotypes, and later with the mutation in genotype, the genotype also differentiates into discrete types, while maintaining the `symbiotic' relationship between the types. Relevance of the theory to natural as well as artificial evolution is discussed.\",\n",

The non-linearity in longitudinal and diagonal resistivity tensor components observed at large electric fields reconciles preceding contradictory results.

These states have the energy in the middle of the superconducting gap and manifest themselves as a zero-bias peak in tunneling conductance into the corresponding edge. Their existence is related to the sign change of the pairing potential around the Fermi surface.

       " 'The complex spaciotemporal patterns of atmospheric flows that result from the cooperative existence of fluctuations ranging in size from millimetres to thousands of kilometres are found to exhibit long-range spacial and temporal correlations. These correlations are manifested as the self-similar fractal geometry of the global cloud cover pattern and the inverse power-law form for the atmospheric eddy energy spectrum. Such long-range spaciotemporal correlations are ubiquitous in extended natural dynamical systems and are signatures of deterministic chaos or self-organized criticality. In this paper, a cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows is developed by consideration of microscopic domain eddy dynamical processes. This nondeterministic model enables formulation of a simple closed set of governing equations for the prediction and description of observed atmospheric flow structure characteristics as follows. The strange-attractor design of the field of deterministic chaos in atmospheric flows consists of a nested continuum of logarithmic spiral circulations that trace out the quasi-periodic Penrose tiling pattern, identified as the quasi-crystalline structure in condensed matter physics. The atmospheric eddy energy structure follows laws similar to quantum mechanical laws. The apparent wave-particle duality that characterize quantum mechanical laws is attributed to the bimodal phenomenological form of energy display in the bidirectional energy flow that is intrinsic to eddy circulations, e.g., formation of clouds in updrafts and dissipation of clouds in downdrafts that result in the observed discrete cellular geometry of cloud structure.',\n",

We show that, despite significant variances in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks display the same topologic scaling properties demonstrating striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This suggests that the metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.',\n",

The method, called extremal optimization, is inspired by self-organized criticality, a concept introduced to describe emergent complexity in physical systems. Extremal optimization successively replaces extremely undesirable variables of a single sub-optimal solution with new, random ones. Large fluctuations ensue, that efficiently explore many local optima. With only one adjustable parameter, the heuristic's performance has proven competitive with more elaborate methods, especially near phase transitions which are believed to coincide with the hardest instances. We use extremal optimization to elucidate the phase transition in the 3-coloring problem, and we provide independent confirmation of previously reported extrapolations for the ground-state energy of +-J spin glasses in d=3 and 4.\",\n",

       " 'A Hubbard model at half-filling on an anisotropic triangular lattice has been proposed as the minimal model to describe conducting layers of $\\\\kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2X$ organic materials. The model interpolates between the square lattice and decoupled chains. The $\\\\kappa-(BEDT-TTF)_2X$ materials present many similarities with cuprates, such as the presence of unconventional metallic properties and the close proximity of superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases. As in the cuprates, spin fluctuations are expected to play a crucial role in the onset of superconductivity. We perform a weak-coupling renormalization-group analysis to show that a superconducting instability occurs. Frustration in the antiferromagnetic couplings, which arises from the underlying geometrical arrangement of the lattice, breaks the perfect nesting of the square lattice at half-filling. The spin-wave instability is suppressed and a superconducting instability predominates. For the isotropic triangular lattice, there are again signs of long-range magnetic order, in agreement with studies at strong-coupling.',\n",

We postulate that the Wilson loops are located at the mimimum length scale $R$ in the fifth radial coordinate. We find that they exhibit a crossover from Coulomb type of behaviour for large loops, for which non-commutativity is unimportant, to area law for small loops, for which non-commutativity effects are large. The string tension, which can be read off from the area law, is controlled by the non-commutativity scale. The crossover itself, however, appears to involve loops of size of order $R$ which is much larger than the non-commutativity scale. The existence of the area law in non-commutative super Yang-Mills theory which persists up to a large crossover length scale provides further evidence for connection to an underlying string theory.',\n",

These growing networks are built by adding nodes successively and linking each to an earlier node of degree k with attachment probability A_k. When A_k grows slower than linearly with k, the number of nodes with k links, N_k(t), decays faster than a power-law in k, while for A_k growing faster than linearly in k, a single node emerges which connects to nearly all other nodes. When A_k is asymptotically linear, N_k(t) tk^{-nu}, with nu dependent on details of the attachment probability, but in the range 2<nu<infty. The combined age and degree distribution of nodes shows that old nodes typically have a large degree. There is also a significant correlation in the degrees of neighboring nodes, so that nodes of similar degree are more likely to be connected. The size distributions of the in-components and out-components of the network with respect to a given node -- namely, its \"descendants\" and \"ancestors\" -- are also determined. The in-component exhibits a robust s^{-2} power-law tail, where s is the component size.

By virtue of the exactness, the conserving laws are satisfied rigorously in the present expression, which is indispensable for avoiding unphysical solutions. Based on the derived expression, we can calculate the MR within the framework of the Baym-Kadanoff type conserving approximation, by including all the vertex corrections required by the Ward identity. The present expression is significant especially for strongly correlated systems because the current vertex corrections will be much important. On the other hand, if we drop all the vertex corrections in the formula, we get the MR of the relaxation time approximation (RTA), which is commonly used because of the simplicity. However, the RTA is dangerous because it may give unphysical results owing to the lack of conserving laws. In conclusion, the present work enables us to study the MR with satisfying the conserving laws which is highly demanded in strongly correlated electrons, such as high-Tc superconductors, organic metals, and heavy Fermion systems.

The source has been spinning down almost at a constant rate with a spin down rate of   \\\\dot \\\\nu = (-3.54 \\\\pm 0.02) \\\\times 10^{-14} Hz s ^{-1} for more than   15 years. Residuals of pulse arrival times yield a very low level of random walk noise strengths   \\\\sim 2 \\\\times 10^{-20} rad ^{2} sec ^{-3} on a time scale of 383 days, which is four decades lower than that of the HMXRB pulsar Vela X-1. The noise strength is only a factor of 5 greater than that of the low mass X-ray binary pulsar (LMXRB) 4U 1626-67. The low level of the timing noise and the very stable spin down rate of 4U 1907+09 makes this source unique among the HMXRBs, providing another example, in addition to 4U 1626-67, of long term quiet spin down from an accreting source. These examples show that the extended quiet spin down episodes observed in the anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) pulsars 1RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 2259+586 do not necessarly imply that these sources are not accreting pulsars.',\n",

       " 'We introduce and simulate a growth model of the world-wide Web based on the dynamics of outgoing links that is motivated by the conduct of the agents in the real Web to update outgoing links (re)directing them towards constantly changing selected nodes. Emergent statistical correlation between the distributions of outgoing and incoming links is a key feature of the dynamics of the Web. The growth phase is characterized by temporal fractal structures which are manifested in the hierarchical organization of links. We obtain quantitative agreement with the recent empirical data in the real Web for the distributions of in- and out-links and for the size of connected component. In a fully grown network of $N$ nodes we study the structure of connected clusters of nodes that are accessible along outgoing links from a randomly selected node. The distributions of size and depth of the connected clusters with a giant component exhibit supercritical behavior. By decreasing the control parameter---average fraction $\\\\beta $ of updated and added links per time step---towards $\\\\beta_c(N) < 10% $ the Web can resume a critical structure with no giant component in it.

We then establish an explicit formula for the transport modes that appear as diffusion modes in a landscape where the metric is given by the density of active sites.

       " \"G. Moreno's abstract depiction of the Sedenions' normed zero-divisors, as homomorphic to the exceptional Lie group G2, is fleshed out by exploring further structures the A-D-E approach of Lie algebraic taxonomy keeps hidden. A breakdown of table equivalence among the half a trillion multiplication schemes the Sedenions allow is found; the 168 elements of PSL(2,7), defining the finite projective triangle on which the Octonions' 480 equivalent multiplication tables are frequently deployed, are shown to give the exact count of primitive unit zero-divisors in the Sedenions. (Composite zero-divisors, comprising all points of certain hyperplanes of up to 4 dimensions, are also determined.) The 168 are arranged in point-set quartets along the 42 Assessors (pairs of diagonals in planes spanned by pure imaginaries, each of which zero-divides only one such diagonal of any partner Assessor). These quartets are multiplicatively organized in systems of mutually zero-dividing trios of Assessors, a D4-suggestive 28 in number, obeying the 6-cycle crossover logic of trefoils or triple zigzags. 3 trefoils and 1 zigzag determine an octahedral vertex structure we call a box-kite -- seven of which serve to partition Sedenion space. By sequential execution of proof-driven production rules, a complete interconnected box-kite system, or Seinfeld production (German for field of being; American for 1990's television's Show About Nothing), can be unfolded from an arbitrary Octonion and any (save for two) of the Sedenions.

       " 'We present an electrical transport study of the 2-dimensional (2D) organic conductor tau-(P-(S,S)-DMEDT-TTF)_2(AuBr)_2(AuBr_2)_y (y = 0.75) at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. The inter-plane resistivity rho_zz increases with decreasing temperature, with the exception of a slight anomaly at 12 K. Under a magnetic field B, both rho_zz and the in-plane resistivity plane rho_xx show a pronounced negative and hysteretic magnetoresistance with Shubnikov de Haas (SdH)oscillations being observed in some (high quality)samples above 15 T. Contrary to the predicted single, star-shaped, closed orbit Fermi surface from band structure calculations (with an expected approximate area of 12.5% of A_FBZ), two fundamental frequencies F_l and F_h are detected in the SdH signal. These orbits correspond to 2.4% and 6.8% of the area of the first Brillouin zone(A_FBZ), with effective masses F_l = 4.0 +/- 0.5 and F_h = 7.3 +/- 0.1. The angular dependence, in tilted magnetic fields of F_l and F_h, reveals the 2D character of the FS and Angular dependent magnetoresistance (AMRO) further suggests a FS which is strictly 2-D where the inter-plane hopping t_c is virtually absent or incoherent. The Hall constant R_xy is field independent, and the Hall mobility increases by a factor of 3 under moderate magnetic fields. Our observations suggest a unique physical situation where a stable 2D Fermi liquid state in the molecular layers are incoherently coupled along the least conducting direction. The magnetic field not only reduces the inelastic scattering between the 2D metallic layers, but it also reveals the incoherent nature of interplane transport in the AMRO spectrum. The apparent ferromagnetism of the hysteretic magnetoresistance remains an unsolved problem.',\n",
       " \"Transient faults corrupt the content and organization of data structures. A recovery technique dealing with such faults is stabilization, which guarantees, following some number of operations on the data structure, that content of the data structure is legitimate. Another notion of fault tolerance is availability, which is the property that operations continue to be applied during the period of recovery after a fault, and successful updates are not lost while the data structure stabilizes to a legitimate state. The available, stabilizing 2-3 tree supports find, insert, and delete operations, each with O(lg n) complexity when the tree's state is legitimate and contains n items. For an illegitimate state, these operations have O(lg K) complexity where K is the maximum capacity of the tree. Within O(t) operations, the state of the tree is guaranteed to be legitimate, where t is the number of nodes accessible via some path from the tree's root at the initial state. This paper resolves, for the first time, issues of dynamic allocation and pointer organization in a stabilizing data structure.\",\n",

The Heisenberg model is also relevant to the frustrated antiferromagnet, Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$. We find rich phase diagrams for each model.

The effects of fluctuations at finite-N are also discussed. For parameters relevant to Cs$_2$CuCl$_4$ the ground state either exhibits incommensurate spin order, or is in a quantum disordered phase with deconfined spin-1/2 excitations and topological order. The SU(N) Hubbard-Heisenberg model exhibits an insulating dimer phase, an insulating box phase, a semi-metallic staggered flux phase (SFP), and a metallic uniform phase. The uniform and SFP phases exhibit a pseudogap. A metal-insulator transition occurs at intermediate values of the interaction strength.',\n",
       " \"Since the subject of traffic dynamics has captured the interest of physicists, many astonishing effects have been revealed and explained. Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by so-called ``phantom traffic jams'', although they all like to drive fast? What are the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how are they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction of the traffic volume cause a lasting traffic jam? Under which conditions can speed limits speed up traffic? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize in lanes, while similar systems are ``freezing by heating''? Why do self-organizing systems tend to reach an optimal state? Why do panicking pedestrians produce dangerous deadlocks? All these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems. This review article on traffic introduces (i) empirically data, facts, and observations, (ii) the main approaches to pedestrian, highway, and city traffic, (iii) microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts like a general modelling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems.

       " 'Thinking is one of the most interesting mental processes. Its complexity is sometimes simplified and its different manifestations are classified into normal and abnormal, like the delusional and disorganized thought or the creative one. The boundaries between these facets of thinking are fuzzy causing difficulties in medical, academic, and philosophical discussions. Considering the dopaminergic signal-to-noise neuronal modulation in the central nervous system, and the existence of semantic maps in human brain, a self-organizing neural network model was developed to unify the different thought processes into a single neurocomputational substrate. Simulations were performed varying the dopaminergic modulation and observing the different patterns that emerged at the semantic map. Assuming that the thought process is the total pattern elicited at the output layer of the neural network, the model shows how the normal and abnormal thinking are generated and that there are no borders between their different manifestations. Actually, a continuum of different qualitative reasoning, ranging from delusion to disorganization of thought, and passing through the normal and the creative thinking, seems to be more plausible. The model is far from explaining the complexities of human thinking but, at least, it seems to be a good metaphorical and unifying view of the many facets of this phenomenon usually studied in separated settings.',\n",

In a real-world environment the algorithms would only constitute a minor component among the many interacting components. The Internet dramati-cally changes many of the usual assumptions about measuring CBIR performance. Any CBIR benchmark should be designed from a networked systems standpoint. These benchmarks typically introduce communication overhead because the real systems they model are distributed applications. We present our implementation of a client/server benchmark called BIRDS-I to measure image retrieval performance over the Internet. It has been designed with the trend toward the use of small personalized wireless systems in mind. Web-based CBIR implies the use of heteroge-neous image sets, imposing certain constraints on how the images are organized and the type of performance metrics applicable. BIRDS-I only requires controlled human intervention for the compilation of the image collection and none for the generation of ground truth in the measurement of retrieval accuracy. Benchmark image collections need to be evolved incrementally toward the storage of millions of images and that scaleup can only be achieved through the use of computer-aided compilation. Finally, our scoring metric introduces a tightly optimized image-ranking window.',\n",
       " 'We report our studies of the linear and nonlinear rheology of aqueous solutions of the surfactant cetyl trimethylammonium tosylate (CTAT) with varying amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl). The CTAT concentration is fixed at 42mM and the salt concentration is varied between 0mM to 120mM. On increasing the salt (NaCl) concentration, we see three distinct regimes in the zero-shear viscosity and the high frequency plateau modulus data. In regime I, the zero-shear viscosity shows a weak increase with salt concentration due to enhanced micellar growth. The decrease in the zero-shear viscosities with salt concentration in regimes I I and III can be explained in terms of inter-micellar branching. The most intriguing feature of our data however, is the anomalous behavior of the high frequency plateau modulus in regime II (0.12 $\\\\le \\\\frac{[NaCl]}{[CTAT]} \\\\le$ 1. 42). In this regime, the plateau modulus {\\\\it increases} with an increase in NaCl concentration. This is highly counter-intuitive, since the correlation length of concentration fluctuations and hence the plateau modulus $G_{\\\\circ}$ are not expected to change appreciably in the semi-dilute regime. We propose to explain the changes in regime II in terms of the unbinding of the organic counterions (tosylate) from the CTA$^{+}$ surfaces on the addition of NaCl. In the nonlinear flow curves of the samples with high salt content, significant deviations from the predictions of the Giesekus model for entangled micelles are observed.',\n",

Our saser consists of an AlGaAs/GaAs double barrier heterostructure designed to generate an intense beam of transversal acoustic (TA) phonons. To study our system, we begin with a Hamiltonian that describes the decay of primary longitudinal optical phonons (LO_1) into secondary (LO_2) and TA (LO_1 -> LO_2 + TA) and its inverse process (recombination). Using this Hamiltonian, a set of coupled equations of motion for the phonons is obtained. We also consider the interaction between the phonons and its reservoirs. These interactions are introduced in the equations of motion leading to a set of coupled Langevin equations. In order to obtain an expression to describe our saser we apply, in the Langevin equations, an adiabatic elimination of some variables of the subsystem. Following the method above we obtain the value of the injection threshold for the operation of our phonon laser. At this threshold occurs a phase transition from a disordered to a coherent state.

In particular, the crossing of the neutral-ionic borderline appears to be quite different from that of the few known temperature induced neutral-ionic phase transitions. First of all, the ionicity change is continuous. Furthermore, the onset of stack dimerization precedes, rather than accompanies, the neutral-ionic crossing. The (second order) phase transition is then driven by the dimerization, but the extent of dimerization is in turn affected by the ionicity change.',\n",
       " 'The synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic characterization of a high spin cluster comprising eight iron ions, are presented in this contribution. The cluster has formula [(tacn)6Fe8O2(OH)12Br4.3(ClO4)3.7]6H2O, (Fe8PCL) where tacn is the organic ligand 1,4,7-triazacyclononane. It can be considered a derivative of Fe8Br8, a cluster whose low temperature dynamics of the magnetization has been deeply investigated, where four of the bromide ions have been replaced by perchlorate anions. The structure of the central core of the two molecules, [Fe8O(OH)12(tacn)6]8+, is essentially the same, but Fe8PCL has a higher symmetry (Fe8Br8 crystallizes in the acentric P1 space group, while Fe8PCL crystallizes in the P21/c space group, monoclinic). The magnetic properties of Fe8PCL suggest it is very similar to Fe8Br having a S=10 ground state as well. The zero field splitting parameters were accurately determined by HF-EPR measurements. The two clusters have similar axial anisotropy but Fe8PCL has a larger transverse anisotropy. Ac susceptibility measurements revealed the cluster behaves like a superparamagnetic particle. However, due to the occurrence of large terms in the transverse anisotropy, the temperature dependence of the relaxation time can not be reproduced by a simple Arrhenius law. As observed in Fe8Br8, below 350 mK the relaxation time becomes temperature independent, indicating that a pure tunneling regime is attained. The comparison of the tunneling rate in the two clusters shows that in the perchlorate derivative the relaxation process is 35 times faster. The observed ratio of the tunneling rates is in reasonable agreement with that calculated from the tunneling splitting, i.e. the energy difference between the two almost degenerate lowest levels Ms = +/-10, in the two clusters.',\n",
       " \"A quantum causal topology is presented. This is modeled after a non-commutative scheme type of theory for the curved finitary spacetime sheaves of the non-abelian incidence Rota algebras that represent `gravitational quantum causal sets'. The finitary spacetime primitive algebra scheme structures for quantum causal sets proposed here are interpreted as the kinematics of a curved and reticular local quantum causality. Dynamics for quantum causal sets is then represented by appropriate scheme morphisms, thus it has a purely categorical description that is manifestly `gauge-independent'. Hence, a schematic version of the Principle of General Covariance of General Relativity is formulated for the dynamically variable quantum causal sets. We compare our non-commutative scheme-theoretic curved quantum causal topology with some recent $C^{*}$-quantale models for non-abelian generalizations of classical commutative topological spaces or locales, as well as with some relevant recent results obtained from applying sheaf and topos-theoretic ideas to quantum logic proper. Motivated by the latter, we organize our finitary spacetime primitive algebra schemes of curved quantum causal sets into a topos-like structure, coined `quantum topos', and argue that it is a sound model of a structure that Selesnick has anticipated to underlie Finkelstein's reticular and curved quantum causal net. At the end we conjecture that the fundamental quantum time-asymmetry that Penrose has expected to be the main characteristic of the elusive `true quantum gravity' is possibly of a kinematical or structural rather than of a dynamical character, and we also discuss the possibility of a unified description of quantum logic and quantum gravity in quantum topos-theoretic terms.\",\n",
       " 'We study, through large scale stochastic simulations using the noise reduction technique, a large number of simple nonequilibrium limited mobility solid-on-solid growth models. We find that d=2+1 dimensional surface growth in several noise reduced models (most notably the Wolf-Villain and the Larger-Curvature model) exhibits spectacular quasi-regular mound formation with slope selection in their dynamical surface morphology. The mounding instability in these epitaxial growth models does not involve the Ehrlich-Schwoebel step edge diffusion barrier. The mounded morphology in these growth models arises from the interplay between the line tension along step edges in the plane parallel to the average surface and the suppression of noise and island nucleation. The line tension tends to stabilize some of the step orientations that coincide with in-plane high symmetry crystalline directions, and thus the mounds that are formed assume quasi-regular structures. The noise reduction technique developed originally for Eden type models can be used to control the stochastic noise and enhance diffusion along the step edge, which ultimately leads to the formation of quasi-regular mounds during growth. We show that by increasing the diffusion surface length together with supression of nucleation and deposition noise, one can obtain a self-organization of the pyramids in quasi-regular patterns.',\n",

       " 'We formulate a kinetic model of DNA replication that quantitatively describes recent results on DNA replication in the in vitro system of Xenopus laevis prior to the mid-blastula transition. The model describes well a large amount of different data within a simple theoretical framework. This allows one, for the first time, to determine the parameters governing the DNA replication program in a eukaryote on a genome-wide basis. In particular, we have determined the frequency of origin activation in time and space during the cell cycle. Although we focus on a specific stage of development, this model can easily be adapted to describe replication in many other organisms, including budding yeast.',\n",
       " 'The basic workings of inflationary models are summarized, along with the arguments that strongly suggest that our universe is the product of inflation. It is argued that essentially all inflationary models lead to (future-)eternal inflation, which implies that an infinite number of pocket universes are produced. Although the other pocket universes are unobservable, their existence nonetheless has consequences for the way that we evaluate theories and extract consequences from them. The question of whether the universe had a beginning is discussed but not definitively answered. It appears likely, however, that eternally inflating universes do require a beginning.',\n",
       " 'Combining the effect of an intermediate renormalization prescription (zero momentum subtraction) and the background field method (BFM), we show that the algebraic renormalization procedure needed for the computation of radiative corrections within non-invariant regularization schemes is drastically simplified. The present technique is suitable for gauge models and, here, is applied to the Standard Model. The use of the BFM allows a powerful organization of the counterterms and avoids complicated Slavnov-Taylor identities. Furthermore, the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) variation of background fields plays a special role in disentangling Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI) and Slavnov-Taylor identities (STI). Finally, the strategy to be applied to physical processes is exemplified for the process $b\\\\to s\\\\gamma$.',\n",
       " 'A solution to the part and whole problem is presented in this paper by using a complex mathematical representation that permits to define the Holon concept as a unit that remains itself in spite of complex operations such as integration and derivation. This can be done because of the remarkable isomorphic property of Euler Relation. We can then define a domain independent of the observer and the object where the object is embedded. We will then be able to have a Quantum Mechanics solution without the \"observer drawback\", as Karl R. Popper tried to find all his life but from the philosophical point of view and which was Einstein main concern about QM. A unit that has always similar or identical structure or form, despite even complex operations such as integration and derivation, is the ideal unit for the new sciences of complexity or just the systems sciences where structure or form, wholeness, organization, and complexity are main requirements. A table for validating the results obtained is presented in case of the pendulum formula.',\n",
       " \"I propose that the properties of the two outbursts observed in the X-ray transient XTE J1118+480 in 2000 are akin to superoutbursts of SU UMa stars. In these systems a `normal' outburst immediately precedes a 5-10 times longer (`super')outburst. The optical light curve of the outbursts of XTE J1118+480 is remarkably similar to that seen in some SU UMa stars, such as UV Per and T Leo, where the precursor outburst is distinct from the superoutburst, but the time scales are a factor of ~15 different. The first outburst of XTE J1118+480 was relatively short (~1 month) while the second outburst was ~5 times longer. During the second outburst superhumps were seen, a feature characteristic for superoutbursts. The gap of about a month between the two outbursts is longer in X-rays with respect to the optical, a feature not previously recognized for X-ray transients. Also in SU UMa stars the precursor outburst becomes more distinct at shorter wavelengths. Finally, I show that the time of appearance of the superhumps in XTE J1118+480 is consistent with the expected superhump growth time, if the superhump mechanism was triggered during the first outburst. I conclude that the similarity in outburst behaviour in the two types of systems provides further support that a common mechanism is at work to start the long (`super')outbursts.\",\n",
       " \"We consider the electronic properties of layered molecular crystals of the type theta-D$_2$A, where A is an anion and D is a donor molecule such as BEDT-TTF [where BEDT-TTF is bis-(ethylenedithia-tetrathiafulvalene)] which is arranged in the theta type pattern within the layers. We argue that the simplest strongly correlated electron model that can describe the rich phase diagram of these materials is the extended Hubbard model on the square lattice at a quarter filling. In the limit where the Coulomb repulsion on a single site is large, the nearest-neighbour Coulomb repulsion, V, plays a crucial role. When V is much larger than the intermolecular hopping integral t the ground state is an insulator with charge ordering. In this phase antiferromagnetism arises due to a novel fourth-order superexchange process around a plaquette on the square lattice. We argue that the charge ordered phase is destroyed below a critical non-zero value V, of the order of t. Slave boson theory is used to explicitly demonstrate this for the SU(N) generalisation of the model, in the large N limit. We also discuss the relevance of the model to the all-organic family beta''-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$SF$_5$YSO$_3$ where Y = CH$_2$CF$_2$, CH$_2$, CHF.\",\n",
       " \"We propose a phenomenological field theoretical approach to the chemical etching of a disordered-solid. The theory is based on a recently proposed dynamical etching model. Through the introduction of a set of Langevin equations for the model evolution, we are able to map the problem into a field theory related to isotropic percolation. To the best of the authors knowledge, it constitutes the first application of field theory to a problem of chemical dynamics. By using this mapping, many of the etching process critical properties are seen to be describable in terms of the percolation renormalization group fixed point. The emerging field theory has the peculiarity of being ``{\\\\it self-organized}'', in the sense that without any parameter fine-tuning, the system develops fractal properties up to certain scale controlled solely by the volume, $V$, of the etching solution.   In the limit $V \\\\to \\\\infty$ the upper cut-off goes to infinity and the system becomes scale invariant. We present also a finite size scaling analysis and discuss the relation of this particular etching mechanism with Gradient Percolation.   Finally, the possibility of considering this mechanism as a new generic path to self-organized criticality is analyzed, with the characteristics of being closely related to a real physical system and therefore more directly accessible to experiments.\",\n",
       " 'We have analysed archived Ginga data on the Z source Sco X-2 (GX349+2). We present the first detailed investigation of its X-ray fast-time variability, as a function of position in the Z track. During the two-day observation over the period 5-7 March 1989, the source was in the so-called flaring branch, and the lower part of the so-called normal branch. We found broad peaked noise with a centroid frequency and width of ~4-7 Hz and ~6-12 Hz respectively. The peaked noise was strongest in the lower flaring branch, with a maximum fractional rms amplitude of ~3 %. We conclude that it is not a manifestation of atoll source high frequency noise, as had been suggested, and compare it with the power spectral features seen in other Z sources. We find that the peaked noise is markedly different to the quasi-periodic oscillations found in the normal and flaring branches of Sco X-1; however it bears some resemblance to that seen in the flaring branch of Cyg X-2 at low overall intensities.',\n",

       " 'The de Haas - van Alphen effect in quasi-two-dimensional metals is studied at arbitrary parameters. The oscillations of the chemical potential may substantially change the temperature dependence of harmonic amplitudes that is usually used to determine the effective electron mass. Hence, the processing of the experimental data using the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich formula (that assumes the chemical potential to be constant) may lead to substantial errors even in the limit of strong harmonic damping. This fact may explain the difference between the effective electron masses, determined from the de Haas - van Alphen effect and the cyclotron resonance measurements. The oscillations of the chemical potential and the deviations from the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula depend on the reservoir density of states, that exists in organic metals due to open sheets of Fermi surface. This dependence can be used to determine the density of electron states on open sheets of Fermi surface. We present the analytical results of the calculations of harmonic amplitudes in some limiting cases that show the importance of the oscillations of the chemical potential. The algorithm of the simple numerical calculation of the harmonic amplitudes at arbitrary reservoir density of states, arbitrary warping, spin-splitting, temperature and Dingle temperature is also described.',\n",
       " 'The spacing intervals of adjacent Riemann zeta zeros(non-trivial) exhibit fractal(irregular) fluctuations generic to dynamical systems in nature such as fluid flows, heart beat patterns, stock market price index, etc., and are associated with unpredictability or chaos. The power spectra of such fractal space-time fluctuations exhibit universal inverse power law form and signify long-range correlations, identified as self-organized criticality . A cell dynamical system model developed by the author for turbulent fluid flows provides a unique quantification for the observed power spectra in terms of the statistical normal distribution, such that the variance represents the statistical probability densities. Such a result that the additive amplitudes of eddies when squared, represent the statistical probabilities is an observed feature of the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as an electron or photon. Self-organized criticality is therefore a signature of quantum-like chaos in dynamical systems. The model concepts are applicable to all real world(observed) and computed(mathematical model) dynamical systems.   Continuous periodogram analyses of the fractal fluctuations of Riemann zeta zero spacing intervals show that the power spectra follow the unique and universal inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution. The Riemann zeta zeros therefore exhibit quantum-like chaos, the spacing intervals of the zeros representing the energy(variance) level spacings of quantum-like chaos inherent to dynamical systems in nature. The cell dynamical system model is a general systems theory applicable to dynamical systems of all size scales.',\n",

       "Perovskite solar cells based on organometal halides represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. Perovskite solar cells stem from dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3–4%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10%) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18% in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20% are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.\n",

In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">2</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\"> surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3–4%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10%) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18% in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20% are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.</p>\n",

At first, perovskite light absorbers were used as sensitizers in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells. Perovskite can be dissolved in polar solvent because of its ionic solid nature, which limits further development of perovskite-sensitized photoelectrochemical type solar cells. A long-term stable perovskite solar cell was designed in 2012 by replacing liquid with solid HTM. Since then, solid-state perovskite-containing solar cells have been called perovskite solar cells. As of June 10th 2014, the certified record PCE of 17.9% was achieved by the Korean Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), which was certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) </p>\n",
