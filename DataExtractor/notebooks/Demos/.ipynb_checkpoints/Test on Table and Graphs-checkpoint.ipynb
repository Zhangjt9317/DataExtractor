Further increase of the fullerene ratio\\nyielded a negative eﬀect in both Jsc and FF, which resulted in a\\ndecreased PCE. As expected from the low-lying HOMO energy\\nlevels of the polymers, the trend in Voc agrees well with the\\nelectrochemical potentials.

The relatively low Voc of the optimized PBDT-TIIG-\\nbased device should be due to the high-lying HOMO energy\\nlevel of PBDT-TIIG (vide supra). Notably, the HOMO energy\\nlevel of PBDT-TIIG (−4.96 eV) is close to that of P3HT (−5.0\\nto −5.1 eV), and yet, the Voc of P3HT:PCBM cells are typically\\naround 0.6 V.
