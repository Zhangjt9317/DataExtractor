We discover that the optical absorption, frontier orbitals, backbone coplanarity, molecular orientation, solubility, ﬁlm morphology, charge carrier mobility, and solar cell performance are critically inﬂuenced by the heteroarenes in the acceptor subunits. PBDT-IIG exhibits good p-type OFET performance with mobility up to 1.03 × 10−1 e = 2.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas PBDT-TIIG displays ambipolar mobilities of μ s−1. PBDT-IIG and PBDT-TIIG blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) yield promising power conversion eﬃciencies (PCEs) of 5.86% and 2.55%, respectively. The excellent mobility of PBDT-IIG can be attributable to the growing fraction of edge-on packing by the interfacial surface treatment. Although PBDT-TIIG could construct a long-range face- on packing alignment to meliorate its photocurrent in OPV applications, the low open-circuit voltage caused by its high-lying HOMO energy level and greater recombination demonstrates the trade-oﬀ between light absorption and solar cell performance. Nevertheless, PBDT-TIIG with a PCE of 2.55% is the highest reported PCE to date for the TIIG-based systems.'))\n",

Though devices containing 2 have exceeded PCEs of 15 %,2a–2c their moisture sensitivity remains a concern for large‐scale device fabrication or their long‐term use. The layered structure of 1 aids the formation of high‐quality films that show greater moisture resistance compared to 2. The larger bandgap of 1 also affords a higher VOC value of 1.18 V compared to devices with 2. Further improvements in material structure and device engineering, including making appropriate electronic contact with the anisotropic inorganic sheets, should increase the PCEs of these devices. In particular, higher values of n as single‐phase materials or as mixtures may allow for lower bandgaps and higher carrier mobility in the inorganic layers while the organic layers provide additional tunability. For example, hydrophobic fluorocarbons could increase moisture stability, conjugated organic layers could facilitate charge transport, and organic photosensitizers could improve the absorption properties of the material. We are focused on manipulating this extraordinarily versatile platform through synthetic design.'),\n",

       "Perovskite solar cells based on organometal halides represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. Perovskite solar cells stem from dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO2 surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3–4%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10%) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18% in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20% are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.\n",

       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">Perovskite solar cells based on organometal halides represent an emerging photovoltaic technology. Perovskite solar cells stem from dye-sensitized solar cells. In a liquid-based dye-sensitized solar cell structure, the adsorption of methylammonium lead halide perovskite on a nanocrystalline TiO</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\">2</p>\n",
       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\"> surface produces a photocurrent with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 3–4%, as first discovered in 2009. The PCE was doubled after 2 years by optimizing the perovskite coating conditions. However, the liquid-based perovskite solar cell receives little attention because of its stability issues, including instant dissolution of the perovskite in a liquid electrolyte. A long-term, stable, and high efficiency (∼10%) perovskite solar cell was developed in 2012 by substituting the solid hole conductor with a liquid electrolyte. Efficiencies have quickly risen to 18% in just 2 years. Since PCE values over 20% are realistically anticipated with the use of cheap organometal halide perovskite materials, perovskite solar cells are a promising photovoltaic technology. In this review, the opto-electronic properties of perovskite materials and recent progresses in perovskite solar cells are described. In addition, comments on the issues to current and future challenges are mentioned.</p>\n",

       "<p class=\"cde-paragraph\"> perovskite showed an absorption coefficient that was 10 times greater than that of the conventional ruthenium-based molecular dye. Since organolead halide perovskite is an ionic crystal, it easily dissolves in a polar solvent. Thus, organolead halide perovskite is not suitable for liquid electrolyte-based sensitized solar cells because of stability concerns. This instability problem was solved by substituting a solid hole conductor for the liquid electrolyte.

At first, perovskite light absorbers were used as sensitizers in liquid dye-sensitized solar cells. Perovskite can be dissolved in polar solvent because of its ionic solid nature, which limits further development of perovskite-sensitized photoelectrochemical type solar cells. A long-term stable perovskite solar cell was designed in 2012 by replacing liquid with solid HTM. Since then, solid-state perovskite-containing solar cells have been called perovskite solar cells. As of June 10th 2014, the certified record PCE of 17.9% was achieved by the Korean Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), which was certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) </p>\n",
