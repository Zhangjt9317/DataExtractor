## APIS 

### API key settings

The following is from Elsevier's development portal:

    An API key has specific API resources, quotas, and service levels enabled by default.

    Access to certain APIs is not enabled by default, because they require additional permission from Elsevier.

    Subscriber and non-subscriber are distinguished by the IP address from which the requests to the API are being made. For example, when a call to the Abstract Retrieval API comes from within a network that is configured for access to Scopus, then the response fits the "subscriber" column. When that same call comes from an anonymous IP address, the response fits the "non-subscriber" column.
